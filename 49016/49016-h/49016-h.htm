<h2 class="no-break">The Purpose of This Book</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Our idea, in preparing this little book, is to set forth,
in clear and simple language, the main features of the
law relating to trade-marks and to illustrate its application
by specific examples of well-known trade-marks now
in use.</p>

<p>To an advertiser who has had but little experience in
registering trade-marks, the law, with a congested mass of
precedents surrounding it, seems to be a legal maze.</p>

<p>But its intricacy is more apparent than real. The law
is quite clear and explicit when one has the patience and
experience in such matters to get to the bottom of it. We
have endeavored to write this book in language so clear that
any business man will understand it, and we feel sure that
it will give any one a good working knowledge of trade-mark
requirements.</p>

<p>It has not been our intention to produce an exhaustive
treatise on the subject. Such a treatment of the law of
trade-marks and its allied subject of unfair trade would
require a large volume, and the long and intricate discussion
of minor points necessary in a work of that kind would
be wearisome and perhaps unintelligible to the lay reader.</p>

<p>Nor have we discussed the origin of the custom of identifying
merchandise by trade-marks. This phase of the
subject&mdash;trade-marks in their historical aspect&mdash;is interesting
in an academic sense, but it has little or no bearing on the
trade-mark situation of to-day.</p>

<p>For further study of the trade-mark law and the allied
subject of the law of unfair trade, we advise the reading of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Hesseltine's "Law of Trade-Marks and Unfair Trade"
(Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1906); and Nims on "Unfair Business
Competition" (Baker, Voorhis &amp; Co.). Both of these
works are legal in their treatment of the subject and in their
phraseology. Another work containing much information
on this subject is Clowry Chapman's "Law of Advertising
and Sales", in two volumes, published by the author.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="dropcap">If you were to ask any dozen men among your acquaintances,
or any hundred men, to name the greatest writer
that has ever lived, the odds are perhaps as great as a
hundred to one that every man would say "Shakespeare."</p>

<p>This virtual unanimity of opinion would not have its
origin in a conscious comparison of authors and their works,
for we might as well be frank with each other and admit
that not more than one of us in a thousand has ever read
enough of Shakespeare to form any opinion that would be
worth listening to.</p>

<p>We take Shakespeare on faith.</p>

<p>We have been taught that Shakespeare was a transcendent
genius, the greatest man that ever put pen to paper,
and we believe it.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is in evidence on every hand. We quote
him every day. He is well advertised. And, needless to
say, his reputation as a writer is far greater to-day than
when he lived over a wig-maker's shop in London, or even
when his fortune had been made, and he had retired with
his jig-saw coat-of-arms to the "lordly mansion" on the hill
back of Stratford.</p>

<p>He has been advertised for three centuries with praise
originating from a thousand sources, and his reputation is
now steeped head and ears in Cumulative Results.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's name has become a sort of trade-mark of
good literature. If a meddling antiquarian should thoughtlessly
add to the afflictions of the intellectual life by unearthing
a doggerel sonnet of Thomas the Rhymer to which some
clerkly scribe had affixed, in error, the name of William
Shakespeare, learned men would read it, and nodding wisely,
would doubtless say, "Pretty good stuff"&mdash;or the scholarly
equivalent of that phrase.</p>

<p>The force of <em>recognized distinction</em> is tremendous, not
only in literature, but in business, in science&mdash;in short, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
one of the most valuable assets in every field of human
endeavor.</p>

<p>A commodity may attain a height of distinction, in the
public's estimation, that places it, among other commodities
of its class, on the level attained by Shakespeare in literature.</p>

<p>Apollinaris among table waters; Heinz "57" among
pickles; Hartshorn rollers among window shade appliances;
Coca-Cola among soda fountain drinks; Huyler's among
candies; Uneeda Biscuit among soda crackers; Horlick's
among malted milks&mdash;each of these products has become, by
reason of advertising combined with intrinsic merit, the
standard of quality in its own class.</p>

<p>It is interesting and easy to make practical tests to ascertain
what advertised commodities have made a genuine and
far-reaching impression on the buying public.</p>

<p>Take talcum powder, for example.</p>

<p>Ask your wife, daughter, sister, stenographer&mdash;and as
many other women as are necessary to strike a general average&mdash;to
write down the name of what each of them considers
the standard talcum powder. Then, when all the
returns are in, figure up the result. There are hundreds
of brands of talcum powder sold in the United States;
but you will find in your canvass that only three or four
are mentioned at all, and that one of them leads all the
rest by a decisive majority. We could tell you what the
figures produced by your experiment would show the leading
brand to be, but a modest reserve in self-assertion forbids
us to say more than that its name begins with the
letter M.</p>

<p>The enviable position of this particular talcum powder
is the sum total of many years' advertising and trade-mark
publicity. It has become a permanent feature of our commercial
life; a sort of Bunker Hill in the history of advertising.
The natural result is that its trade-mark is enormously
valuable.</p>

<p>Advertising capitalizes human faith, and faith is a mental
impression. It is a quality of the human mind that the
most <em>profound impressions are made by things</em>&mdash;not by abstract
ideas. Consequently, successful advertising must be
tied hard and fast to a name (or trade-mark) and this trade-mark
must be distinctive, and not easy to confuse with something
else. It must be easy to remember, <em>and it must
identify the advertised product</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The functions of a trade-mark in advertising may be
concisely stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. As a certificate of genuineness of
the product to which it is affixed. <em>This
protects the public.</em></p>

<p>2nd. As an identifying mark, owned
by the manufacturer, and in the ownership
of which the law protects him in order that
no competitor may reap the advantage of
the selling effort and advertising put forth
by the owner of the trade-mark. <em>This
protects the manufacturer.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In its legal aspect, a trade-mark is therefore a device for
protecting both the manufacturer and the public from
fraud. In this connection, we quote the legal definition of
a trade-mark as given by the Federal Court in the case of
<cite>Shaw Stocking Company vs. Mack</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Broadly defined, a trade-mark is a mark by
which the wares of the owner are known in trade.
Its object is twofold; first, to protect the party
using it from competition with inferior articles;
and second, to protect the public from imposition.... The
trade-mark brands the goods as genuine,
just as the signature of a letter stamps it
as authentic."</p></blockquote>

<p>The law of trade-mark usage, reinforced by a vast array
of legal decisions, is a growth of the last sixty years.</p>

<p>When trade was restricted within narrow geographical
limits by formidable conditions; when both goods and news
traveled slowly; when selling effort was principally made
by word of mouth, there was no genuine need in the commercial
world for the legal regulation of trade-marks, or
for laws designed to repress unfair trade.</p>

<p>In the days of our forefathers manufacturers made
goods; they did not sell them. Goods sold themselves.
And, consequently, the expanding circle of a manufacturer's
trade rippled out with exceeding slowness. A national sale
of any product was the result of perhaps several generations
of slowly expanding effort&mdash;and when once established, it
was generally entrenched far beyond the reach of competitors
or substitutes. People lived simply, and manufactured
articles were few. It is true that trade-marks existed then&mdash;as
they have since the beginning of organized commerce&mdash;but
they were few in number, compared with their multiplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to-day, and their owners were adequately protected
by their ordinary common law rights.</p>

<p>Quickly moving transportation and highly developed
methods of distribution and sale have changed these conditions.</p>

<p>To-day the swift shuttle of commerce flies to the ends of
the world. Advertising has arisen, and has become, in a
generation, the most important of selling forces. People
read and believe the printed word, and they buy goods
manufactured a thousand miles away by some advertiser of
whom they had never heard until they read of him and
his wares. Society has become intricate and complicated.
Thousands are striving to do what one man strove to do a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>From this criss-cross of human activities has been woven
the fabric of the law of unfair trade, which is the progenitor
of the trade-mark statutes. The intent of this body
of law is to give the widest possible freedom to the play of
individual energy in business consistent with justice to others
in trade, and to the public.</p>

<p>The trade-mark is the connecting link between the manufacturer
and the ultimate consumer. By the use of trade-marks,
widely advertised, manufacturers are able to build
up a trade that becomes, to a great degree, independent of
jobber, wholesaler, and retailer. In the public mind a
trade-mark grows, in time, to mean a certain standard of
quality, workmanship and material.</p>

<p>Advertised products are generally higher in quality than
similar products that are not advertised. The reason is
that an investment in enough advertising space to make any
commodity known nationally requires a considerable outlay
of money, besides a well-developed selling organization to
coöperate with the advertising, and harvest its results. And
this must be done continuously, and that means that the
combined advertising and selling effort must be permeated
with a sense of stability and permanency.</p>

<p>The manufacturer who is investing money in advertising,
year after year, feels that he has too much at stake
to endanger his possibilities by putting out inferior goods.
Advertising is a systematic method of creating Good
Reputation&mdash;but when Reputation is only an empty form of
words, with nothing tangible behind it, the chances of its
lasting are rather slight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The manufacturer of inferior goods is not looking very
far into the future. He is not trying to build permanently
on the basis of reputation, but to squeeze out Right Now
every cent of possible profit. The result of this attitude of
mind is that he does not advertise.</p>

<p>Consequently it is not surprising to find that the best
merchandise on any retailer's shelves consists of advertised
goods, and that, moreover, concerns that advertise have the
most efficient sales organizations, as well as the most enlightened
relations with retailers and the public.</p>

<p>The best trade-mark ever devised is not worth a cent
until it has become known as an identifying mark of a
commodity. A trade-mark has no inherent, natural value.
Whatever it is worth is the result of advertising in some
form, plus the desirable qualities of the goods that it
represents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some trade-marks are words which have a natural
affinity for the language, and they slide into common speech
as easily as a cupful of water melts into the ocean.</p>

<p>A notable instance of this is "Cracker Jack." This
word has become an integral part of our common language,
and is used to mean a hustler, a thing of excellence, a fellow
who gets there, a machine that runs smoothly, a well-played
game, and in other senses. But it is probable that not one
person in a hundred who uses this word knows that it is
a registered trade-mark, and that it is a name applied to a
mixture of popcorn and peanuts, combined with molasses,
or some other sweetening. It is a delicious concoction, as
any reader of this book may ascertain for himself.</p>

<p>The owners of Cracker Jack have not advertised. They
have allowed the immense asset of their trade-mark&mdash;a by-word
on the tongues of millions&mdash;to go to waste.</p>

<p>The word "Celluloid" is protected by the trade-mark
law. The article celluloid can be manufactured by any
one who cares to go into the business of making it, but only
the owners of the trade-mark can call their product celluloid.
This is not generally known, probably not even by
the well-informed class of readers among whom this book
will circulate&mdash;a state of public ignorance due to lack of
advertising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kodak," an artificial word&mdash;a registered trade-mark&mdash;widely
advertised, has grown into common use, and is now
used by many persons to mean a small hand camera of
any make, though (as every reader of this book knows) a
real Kodak is made only by the Eastman Company.</p>

<p>In this case the owners of the trade-mark have made
their advertising keep pace with the diffusion of the word.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<div class="boxleft">
<p class="center xxlargefont">"KODAK"</p>

<p>Is our Registered and
common-law <em>Trade-Mark</em>
and cannot be rightfully
applied except to goods
of our manufacture.</p>

<p class="smallfont">If a dealer tries to sell you a camera
or films, or other goods not of
our manufacture, under the Kodak
name, you can be sure that he has an
inferior article that he is trying to
market on the Kodak reputation.</p>

<p class="center"><em>If it isn't an Eastman, it isn't a Kodak.</em></p>

</div>

<div class="boxleftnoborder" style="text-align: left">
<b><em>Special advertising to counteract
the indiscriminate use of the word
"Kodak."</em></b></div>
</div>

<p>It is easier to say Kodak than it is to say "portable
camera". There is a real need
in the language for such a
word, and "Kodak" has come
to supply it.</p>

<p>Trade-marks of this character,
which seem to supply a
genuine linguistic need, are, in
a sense, <em>too good</em>. The indiscriminate
application of "Kodak"
to a certain class of
cameras, irrespective of origin,
has caused the Eastman Kodak
Company to publish many
advertisements with the special
purpose of calling attention
to the correct use of the word.</p>

<p>The word "O'Sullivan"
is another instance of a trade-name
acquiring a secondary
meaning through advertising.
It instantly brings to mind the thought of rubber heels. In
a popular play an actor says, "I got away from there on my
O'Sullivan's" and every one in the audience knows that he
means to say that he left as quietly as he could.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There comes a time, in the history of every manufacturer
who advertises extensively and successfully for a long period,
when his trade-mark, and the name of his product (in many
cases they are the same), become by-words of common
speech, known to all men, and incorporated into our fluid
and elastic language. When an advertiser reaches this
point, he has generally attained the highest possible advertising
success. In other words, advertising has done for
him all it can do, and he has only to keep the stream of
advertising going to hold what he has.</p>

<h2><span class="mediumfont">CHAPTER I</span><br />

A Digest of the Trade-Mark Law</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In February, 1905, Congress passed an act entitled "An
act to authorize the registration of trade-marks used in
commerce with foreign nations or among the several
states or with Indian tribes, and to protect the same."</p>

<p>This act went into effect on April 1, 1905. With its
amendments it is known as the United States Trade-Mark
Law. Its provisions should be known by every manufacturer
or advertiser who is using, or who intends to adopt,
a trade-mark.</p>


<h3 id="Section_13">Property in Trade-Marks
Does Not Rest upon the Statute,
But upon the Common Law.</h3>

<p>It should be stated here that ownership in a trade-mark
is a property right resting in the common law. This right
is, therefore, not a creation of the statute. The purpose of
the statute (or Act of 1905) is to systematize the registration
of trade-marks, and to provide a definite procedure both
for recording and protecting them. A trade-mark may be
legally valid without having been registered, and on the other
hand, a registered mark may be proved legally invalid.
Registration is prima facie evidence of validity, but it is not
conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>Upon this subject the Supreme Court of the United
States has said, "The right to adopt and use a symbol or
device to distinguish the goods or property made or sold by
the person whose mark it is, to the exclusion of use by all
other persons, has been long recognized by the common law
and the chancery courts of England and of this country. It
is a property right for the violation of which damages may
be recovered in an action at law, and the continued violation
of it will be enjoined by a court of equity with compensation
for past infringements. This exclusive right was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
not created by the act of Congress and does not now depend
upon it for its enforcement."</p>

<p>The common law rights of the owner of a trade-mark
are the same now as they were before the passage of the
act. In fact, the statute itself contains this provision:
"Nothing in this act shall prevent, lessen, impeach or avoid
any remedy at law, or in equity, which any party aggrieved
by any wrongful use of any trade-mark might have had if
the provisions of this act had not been passed". (Section 23
of Act of 1905.)</p>

<p>The advantages of registration are readily apparent,
however. In an action at law against infringement, the
owner of a registered trade-mark can produce at once the
record of its <em>adoption and legal registration</em>. Without
registration, it would be necessary for him to go through an
involved legal process to prove his rights in the matter.</p>

<p>Registration in the United States Patent Office brings
any litigation involving the right to use the trade-mark
within the scope of the Federal court, with a judiciary
trained in such cases. When a trade-mark is not registered
under the Federal law a suit pertaining to it cannot be heard
in the United States courts, unless the amount in dispute
exceeds two thousand dollars, and the parties on the opposing
sides are not citizens of the same state.</p>

<p>Under the Act of 1905 about 39,000 trade-marks had
been registered, up to September 1, 1911.</p>


<h3 id="Section_14">Conditions of Registration</h3>

<p>An individual or a corporation has a right to register a
trade-mark under the United States law if the trade-mark
for which registration is sought belongs to the applicant and
is used by him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. In commerce among the several
states;</p>

<p>2nd. Or, in commerce with foreign
nations;</p>

<p>3rd. Or, in commerce with the Indian
tribes;</p>

<p>Provided the owner of the trade-mark
resides within the territory of the United
States (which includes all territory under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
United States control), or has a manufacturing
establishment situated in United
States territory, or resides in any foreign
country which affords, by treaty, similar
privileges to citizens of the United States.</p></blockquote>

<p>The law states, as a condition of validity, in explicit
terms that the trade-mark must not only belong to the
applicant, but must be "<em>used by him</em>." A trade-mark cannot
be registered until it has actually been used on goods,
and the use must be continued long enough, and must be
of such a nature as to indicate a genuine intention on the
part of the owner to adopt the trade-mark as a permanent
accessory of his business.</p>

<p>The reason for this is evident. If any citizen could
appropriate and sequester a trade-mark by paying the registration
fee of ten dollars, without an intention of using it
for its legitimate purpose, it does not take much imagination
to foresee a Trade-Mark Trust, with most of the desirable
trade-marks in the hands of a monopoly, to be farmed out
at a profit.</p>

<p><b>To be Registrable
A Trade-Mark Must Be:</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. An arbitrary symbol, or word, or words,
or a combination of a device and wording, not
obviously descriptive of the commodity to which
it is to be applied.</p>

<p>2nd. Unlike any other trade-mark, already
in use, and applied to the same class of goods.
It must not resemble the trade-mark of a competitor,
or of a potential competitor, to such an
extent that the buying public is likely to be deceived
or confused by the resemblance.</p>

<p>3rd. Used in lawful trade.</p>

<p>4th. Of such a character that it may be
affixed, printed upon, woven, sewed, branded or
otherwise impressed upon the product with which
it is used, or upon the package or container of
the product.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>A Trade-Mark Must Not Be:</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. A portrait of a living individual unless
the application for registration is accompanied
by the written consent of the individual whose
portrait is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>2nd. Scandalous or immoral matter of any
description.</p>

<p>3rd. The flag or coat of arms of the United
States, or of any state, or of any municipality,
or any of the insignia thereof.</p>

<p>4th. The insignia of the American National
Red Cross Society.</p>

<p>5th. The flag or coat of arms of any foreign
nation.</p>

<p>6th. Any design or picture which has been
adopted by a fraternal society as its emblem.</p>

<p>7th. A design or wording identical with a
registered or known trade-mark owned and in
use by another, and appropriated to merchandise
of the same descriptive qualities, or which so
nearly resembles a registered or known trade-mark
owned and used by another, and appropriated
to merchandise of the same descriptive
qualities, as to be likely to cause confusion or
mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive
purchasers.</p>

<p>8th. Any mark which consists merely in the
name of an individual, firm, corporation, or
association, unless said name is written, printed,
impressed or woven in some particular or distinctive
manner, or is used in connection with a
portrait of the individual.</p>

<p>9th. Any arrangement of words or devices
descriptive of the goods with which they are
used, or of the character or quality of such
goods. In other words, a trade-mark must not
be an advertisement in the ordinary sense of
the word.</p>

<p>10th. Any geographical name or term.</p>

<p>11th. A misrepresentation of the quality,
composition, character, origin, or nature of the
commodity with which it is used.</p></blockquote>

<p>This looks like a problem in geometry, but it isn't.</p>

<p>This diagram shows at a glance how Trade-Mark
Advertising draws a straight line between the manufacturer
and the consumer.</p>

<p>The manufacturer who doesn't advertise has to
depend on the jobber and the retailer. In the majority
of cases his name never reaches the consumer. His
trade is necessarily precarious, and he is constantly
in danger of the kind of cut-throat competition that
shaves the lowest margin of profit to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="textred">But the manufacturer who advertises has his name
and the name of his goods on the lips of millions of
people.</span> The retailer who attempts to keep advertised
goods from selling is like the man who cuts off his
nose to spite his face. People will go elsewhere and
get what they want.</p>

<p>A special provision of the Act of 1905 legalized all
trade-marks that had been in <em>exclusive use</em> by the applicant
for <span id="Section_16">ten years</span> prior to the passage of the act, and this provision
applies even to trade-marks of ten years' standing that,
because of their character, could not be registered under the
act. The language of the act dealing with this subject is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing herein (in the Act of 1905) shall prevent the registration
of any mark used by the applicant or his predecessors, or by
those from whom title to the trade-mark is derived, in commerce
with foreign nations or among the several states, or with Indian

applicant or his predecessors from whom he derived title for ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
years next preceding the passage of this act." (Section 5, Act of
1905.)</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many trade-marks
registered under this ten years'
clause.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are prohibited from
using the insignia of the Red Cross
Society as a trade-mark, but there is
a Red Cross Shoe, and the products
of the well-known druggists' specialty
house of Johnson &amp; Johnson
bear a Red Cross symbol. In both
cases, their right is based on long and
continuous use antedating the act of
1905, which especially exempts such
cases.</p>


<h3 id="Section_17">How to Apply for Registration</h3>

<p>The registration of trade-marks is under the supervision
of the Commissioner of Patents, and regular forms for registration
are prescribed. Copies of these forms may be obtained
by applying to the Patent Office.</p>

<p>In applying for trade-mark registration, the following
provisions of the law must be observed:</p>

<p>1st. The applicant must file a <em>Petition</em> in the Patent
Office, addressed to the Commissioner of Patents. This
petition must be in regular form, and should be signed and
dated.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px; display: inline-block">

Case Co.</em></p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>2nd. With the petition a <em>Statement</em> must be forwarded.
This document must give the name, domicile, location and
citizenship of the applicant; the class of merchandise and
the particular description of goods comprised in such class
to which the trade-mark is appropriated; a statement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mode in which the trade-mark
is to be affixed to the goods; and
the length of time during which
the trade-mark has been used.
It is not necessary to give a written
description of the trade-mark
itself except when it contains
colors not shown in the drawing.
This statement must be signed
by the applicant. Where a corporation
is the applicant, the
secretary should sign the statement. When a partnership
is the applicant, any partner can sign, but the names of all
the members of the firm must be given.</p>

<p>3rd. There should also be forwarded to the Patent
Office, at the same time, a <em>Declaration</em> of the applicant,
sworn to before a notary public, to the effect that he believes
the statements made in his application are true; that he believes
himself to be the owner of the trade-mark sought to be
registered; and that said trade-mark is used by him in commerce
among the several states of the United States, with
the Indian tribes, or with foreign nations; and that the
drawing sent with the application truly represents the trade-mark
sought to be registered.</p>

<p>4. With this application there must be filed a <em>Drawing</em>
of the trade-mark, made according to the following specifications:
The size of the sheet on which the drawing is
made must be exactly 10 x 15 inches, and the sheet must
be of pure white paper, corresponding in thickness to two-sheet
Bristol board. The surface of the paper must be
calendered and smooth. India ink must be used. One
inch from its edges a single marginal line must be drawn,
as shown in the accompanying cut, leaving the dimensions
inside the border exactly 8 x 13 inches.</p>

</div>

<p>Within this border, the drawing and signatures must be
included. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded
as its top, and measuring downwardly from the marginal
line, a space of not less than <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> inches is to be left blank
for the heading of title, name, number and date. All
drawing must be made with the pen only. Every line and
letter, including signatures, must be absolutely black. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
name of the proprietor of the trade-mark, signed by himself,
or his attorney of record, must be placed at the lower right-hand
corner of the sheet within the marginal lines.</p>

<p>5th. With the application five <em>Specimens</em>, or facsimiles,
of the trade-mark as actually used upon the goods, must be
sent to the Commissioner of Patents.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing is a brief
resumé of the rules for registration.
Those intending to
register trade-marks should
obtain exact forms from the
Commissioner of Patents.</p>

<p>A certificate of registration remains in force for twenty
years, and it may be renewed from time to time, upon
expiration, for like periods of twenty years, upon payment
of a renewal fee of ten dollars.</p>

<p>The owner of a trade-mark may prosecute his own application
for registration, but he is advised, unless familiar
with such matters, to employ a competent attorney. A
register of attorneys is kept in the Patent Office, on which
is entered the names of all persons entitled to represent
applicants before the Patent Office in the prosecution of
applications for patents, and any registered attorney will
be recognized in the prosecution of applications for registration
of trade-marks.</p>


<h3 id="Section_20">Procedure of the Patent Office</h3>

<p>The examiner in charge of trade-marks examines all
applications for registration. If, after examination, registration
is refused, the applicant will be notified, and the
reasons for refusal stated, in order that the applicant may
judge of the propriety of prosecuting his application further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>If, on examination of an application, it appears that a
trade-mark is entitled to registration, the mark will be published
at least once in the Official Gazette of the Patent
Office. Such publication shall be at least thirty days prior
to the date of registration.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A Sherwin-Williams

</div>

<p>If no notice of opposition be filed within thirty days
after such publication, the applicant or his attorney will
be notified of the allowance of his application,
and a certificate of registration
will be granted.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions amendments
may be made in an application.</p>

<p>Every applicant whose mark has been
twice refused registration by the Examiner
of Trade-marks for the same
reasons upon grounds involving the merits
of the application, may appeal to the
Commissioner, in person, upon a payment
of a fee of fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>From an adverse decision by the Commissioner of
Patents an appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals

<p>If, upon examination of an application
to register a trade-mark, the examiner in
charge finds that the mark for which registration
is sought is identical with, or essentially
similar to, a trade-mark appropriated
to goods of the same descriptive qualities,
for which a certificate of registration has
been already issued, an interference will
be declared.</p>

<p>When an interference is declared, the
matter in dispute is referred to the Commissioner
of Patents, who, under the rules
of the Patent Office, passes judgment upon the points at
issue.</p>

<p>Any person who believes he would be damaged by the
registration of a mark may oppose the same by filing a written
notice of opposition, stating the grounds therefor, within
thirty days after the publication of the mark sought to be
registered, which notice of opposition shall be accompanied
by the fee required by law ($10.00) and shall be verified
by the person filing the same before one of the officers mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in Section 2 of the Act of February 20, 1905.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> An
opposition may be filed by a duly authorized attorney, but
such opposition shall be null and void unless duly verified
by the opposer, within a reasonable time after such filing.
A duplicate copy of the notice of opposition
must be filed, either with the
notice of opposition or within a reasonable
time after the filing of the same.</p>

<p>Any person, deeming himself to be
injured by the registration of a trade-mark
in the Patent Office, may, at any
time, make application to the Commissioner
to cancel the registration thereof. Such application
shall be filed in duplicate, shall state the grounds for
cancelation, and shall be verified by the person filing the
same, before one of the officers mentioned in Section 2 of the
Act of February 20, 1905.</p>

<p>If it shall appear, after a hearing before the examiner
of interferences, that the registrant was not entitled to the
use of the mark at the date of his application for registration
thereof, or that the mark is not used by the registrant,
or has been abandoned, and the examiner in charge of interferences
shall so decide, the Commissioner shall cancel the
registration of the mark, unless appeal be taken within the
limit fixed.</p>

<p>In cases of opposition, and of applications
for cancelation, the examiner in
charge of trade-marks shall forward the
files and papers to the examiner in charge
of interferences, who shall give notice
thereof to the applicant or registrant. The
applicant or registrant must make answer
at such time, not less than thirty days from
the day of the notice, as shall be fixed by

<p>The law directs that the owner of a registered trade-mark
print, or impress, or affix, in legible letters, the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="center largefont">
<b>Registered in U. S. Patent Office<br />

<p>upon such trade-mark wherever it is used, or sufficiently near
it to be discerned whenever the trade-mark is seen. The
manner in which this should be done is shown in connection
with the "Fine-Form" Maternity Skirt trade-mark on this
page. When, from the character
or size of the trade-mark,
or from its manner
of attachment to the article,
this cannot be done, a label
containing a like notice
should be affixed to the package
or receptacle wherein
the article is enclosed.</p>

<p>It is important that this be done, otherwise, in a suit for
infringement by a party who has failed to give such notice
of registration no damages shall be recovered, except on
proof that the defendant was duly notified of infringement,
and continued the same after such notice.</p>


<h3 id="Section_23a">Registration in Foreign Countries</h3>

<p>American owners of trade-marks who expect to do
business in foreign countries should not neglect the registration
of their trade-marks abroad. A failure to observe this
precaution has led, in some cases, to a situation where the
American owner, entering the foreign field, found his
trade-mark already appropriated. The trade-mark laws of
various foreign countries differ greatly, in some instances,
from the United States law. A manufacturer who desires to
do business in a foreign country should consult a trade-mark
attorney who specializes in foreign trade-mark registration
and protection, and be guided by his advice.</p>


<h3 id="Section_23b">Classification of Merchandise</h3>

<p>The right to use a trade-mark is limited to the class of
merchandise for which it is registered, and to the goods,
falling within that class, on which it has been actually used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>For the purpose of classification the Patent Office has
issued a list of forty-nine general classes of merchandise.
An applicant for the registration of a trade-mark must
specify the class of merchandise with which his mark has
been used, and must describe the particular goods in that
class on which it has been used. In case his application is
granted, his right to use the trade-mark is confined to the
line of products named in his application.</p>

<p>The list follows:</p>

<p class="listhang1">1. Raw or partly prepared materials.</p>

<p class="listhang1">2. Receptacles.</p>

<p class="listhang1">3. Baggage, horse equipments, portfolios, and pocket-books.</p>

<p class="listhang1">4. Abrasive, detergent, and polishing materials.</p>

<p class="listhang1">5. Adhesives.</p>

<p class="listhang1">6. Chemicals, medicines, and pharmaceutical preparations.</p>

<p class="listhang1">7. Cordage.</p>

<p class="listhang1">8. Smokers' articles, not including tobacco products.</p>

<p class="listhang1">9. Explosives, firearms, equipments, and projectiles.</p>

<p class="listhang2">10. Fertilizers.</p>

<p class="listhang2">11. Inks and inking materials.</p>

<p class="listhang2">12. Construction materials.</p>

<p class="listhang2">13. Hardware and plumbing and steam-fitting supplies.</p>

<p class="listhang2">14. Metals and metal castings and forgings.</p>

<p class="listhang2">15. Oils and greases.</p>

<p class="listhang2">16. Paints and painters' materials.</p>

<p class="listhang2">17. Tobacco products.</p>

<p class="listhang2">19. Vehicles, not including engines.</p>

<p class="listhang2">20. Linoleum and oiled cloth.</p>

<p class="listhang2">21. Electrical apparatus, machines, and supplies.</p>

<p class="listhang2">22. Games, toys, and sporting goods.</p>

<p class="listhang2">23. Cutlery, machinery, and tools, and parts thereof.</p>

<p class="listhang2">24. Laundry appliances and machines.</p>

<p class="listhang2">25. Locks and safes.</p>

<p class="listhang2">26. Measuring and scientific appliances.</p>

<p class="listhang2">34. Heating, lighting, and ventilating apparatus, not including
      electrical apparatus.</p>

<p class="listhang2">35. Belting, hose, machinery packing, and non-metallic tires.</p>

<p class="listhang2">36. Musical instruments and supplies.</p>

<p class="listhang2">37. Paper and stationery.</p>

<p class="listhang2">38. Prints and publications.</p>

<p class="listhang2">39. Clothing.</p>

<p class="listhang2">40. Fancy goods, furnishings, and notions.</p>

<p class="listhang2">41. Canes, parasols, and umbrellas.</p>

<p class="listhang2">42. Knitted, netted, and textile fabrics.</p>

<p class="listhang2">43. Thread and yarn.</p>

<p class="listhang2">44. Dental, medical, and surgical appliances.</p>

<p class="listhang2">45. Beverages, non-alcoholic.</p>

<p class="listhang2">46. Foods and ingredients of foods.</p>

<p class="listhang2">47. Wines.</p>

<p class="listhang2">48. Malt extracts and liquors.</p>

<p class="listhang2">49. Distilled alcoholic liquors.</p>

<p class="listhang2">50. Merchandise not otherwise classified.</p>

<p>(Note: Class 18 was abolished Feb. 24, 1909.)</p>

<p>As a result of this feature of the law products in various
non-competitive lines sometimes bear the same names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
There is, for example, a Yale<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> lock and a Yale motorcycle,
an Ideal hairbrush and an Ideal fountain pen, a
Packard piano and a Packard automobile, a Skidoo soap
and a Skidoo Marine engine.</p>


<h3 id="Section_25">State Trade-Mark Laws</h3>

<p>Most states have some kind of a trade-mark law, many
of them good ones, and about a dozen have strong penal
codes covering the subject, under the term of counterfeiting,
while others are able to do what the United
States courts cannot do&mdash;actually mete out imprisonment
to those who infringe. Pennsylvania's law in this respect
is particularly thorough.</p>

<p>The Federal statutes concerning trade-marks apply to
the entire country. Few large concerns doing a national
business register in the states. Most of them go to the
Patent Office and secure national registration.</p>

<p>There is nothing in any of the state laws which make it
safer to register by states, since California's obnoxious law
has been repealed, but in some cases, where persistent infringers
are at work, owners of trade-marks secure state registration
as an extra precaution.</p>

Essentials of a Valid
Trade-Mark</h2>

<p class="dropcap">To a layman the trade-mark law seems, at first consideration,
to be a crystallized system of arbitrary rules
without a fundamental underlying principle.</p>

<p>A study of its application will show that this is a mistaken
view of the case. As a matter of fact, the law is
excellently framed, and is based on a broad principle which
draws a just line of cleavage between the rights of an individual
and his encroachment upon the rights of others.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_028.png" width="175" height="160" alt="TRADE MARK, Thomas A Edison" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>An illustrious and valuable
trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the practical workings of a law which deals with commercial
activities in their most highly
developed phase, in a sphere where
the ingenuity of men is on fertile
ground, in cases where the weight of
a hair would make the difference between
yea and nay, it is inevitable
that many fine distinctions must be
drawn.</p>

<p>The courts, by contradictory decisions,
have here and there brought
confusion into the practice of the
Patent Office, as applied to trade-mark procedure, but, on the
whole, the judicial interpretation of the law has been fairly
uniform and consistent.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned here, for the reader's information,
that the attitude of the Patent Office toward applications for
the registration of trade-marks has been criticized, on various
occasions, by some of those who have had dealings with it.
Its rulings have been characterized as narrow and illiberal,
especially in the matter of trade-marks alleged to be
descriptive in their nature.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we laid down briefly the requisites
of a valid trade-mark. We shall now discuss these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
requirements more fully, using specific and generally well-known
examples of trade-marks to illustrate our meaning.</p>


<h3 id="Section_27">A Portrait of a Living Individual
Cannot be Registered as a Trade-Mark
Unless by Consent of the Individual
Whose Portrait is Used, or, if a Minor,
by Consent of his Legal Guardian</h3>

<p>This section of the law is based on the recognized right
of any person to prohibit the unauthorized reproduction of
his portrait for any advertising purpose. In some of the
states&mdash;New York, for example&mdash;there are state laws specifically
forbidding such unauthorized reproduction.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_029a.png" width="150" height="195" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>Registered as a
trade-mark by
the Saturday
Evening Post.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>While the law prohibits the registration
of a living individual's portrait as a
trade-mark, without that person's consent,
it is allowable to use the portrait of
a historical character.</p>

<p>The trade-mark of the Robert Burns
Cigar is a picture of the poet Burns, with
his facsimile signature.</p>

<p>Pictures of Franklin, Napoleon, Henry
Clay, Bismarck, and many other famous
men are used as trade-marks. A cereal recently
placed on the market under the name of "Washington
Crisps" carries George Washington's portrait on the
package.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin's face is registered as a trade-mark
by the Curtis Publishing Company, and is printed in this
connection on the editorial page of
the Saturday Evening Post.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_029b.png" width="200" height="201" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>This face has been printed more
times than any other portrait ever used in advertising.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A celebrated instance of a face
used as a trade-mark is shown in
the picture of Gerhard Mennen on
this page. Mennen's Talcum Powder
was produced by Gerhard Mennen,
who had his own picture put on
each package as an identification to
the purchaser. After years of use,
his portrait was formally registered
in the Patent Office.</p>

<p>Another famous face is that of W. L. Douglas, shoe
manufacturer and Ex-Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A very effective trade-mark is a combination of Thomas
A. Edison's portrait and signature, used with the Edison
Phonograph. Edison is known by reputation to every American,
and his picture and signature used in connection with
a mechanical device, give it the stamp of high excellence.
Imagine how much more difficult the selling effort of the
Edison Phonograph Company would have been if they had
called their instrument The Voltex Phonograph, for example,
or some similar name.</p>

<p>Everybody has seen the Woodbury face, which is identified
with Woodbury's Facial Soap, and other preparations
of the Andrew Jergens Company of Cincinnati. This is
a very valuable trade-mark, on account of the extensive
advertising, running through many years, that has been given
it. One of the striking features of this trade-mark is that
the head seems to be neatly decapitated just under the chin.
This odd appearance makes the memory of this picture stick
in the reader's mind longer than any ordinary portrayal of a
human face.</p>


<h3 id="Section_28">A Valid Trade-Mark Cannot Be
any Arrangement of Words or Devices
Descriptive of the Goods with which
They are Used, or of the Character
or Quality of the Goods</h3>

<p>The intent of the law here is to prevent the individual
appropriation of general terms descriptive of a class of
goods. If it were allowable to register and protect such
phrases as "The Best Soap in the World", applied to a
certain brand of soap, for instance, it is easy to see that all
desirable superlatives and descriptive words would soon be
appropriated, to the detriment of other concerns in the same
line of trade. Therefore, the law makes strict provision
that a trade-mark shall not be descriptive in any sense.</p>

<p>Though this is the intent of the law, in its working out
the line seems to be finely drawn in some cases.</p>

<p>"Royal" has been held to be a valid trade-mark for a
baking powder on the ground that it has been long used as
the name of the total output of a factory, and that it has
become to the public mind a designation of origin. It seems
difficult for a layman to reconcile this decision with that of
another court, which held that "Royal" is not a valid trade-mark
for flour, as it indicates "quality and is incapable of
exclusive appropriation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The word "Ideal" is held to be a valid trade-mark for
a fountain pen, its use in this connection being fanciful and
not descriptive.</p>

<p>The word "Naphtha", used as a name for a soap with
naphtha as an ingredient, was held to be descriptive, and
therefore not registrable as a trade-mark, to the exclusion of
the goods of other manufacturers, although the owners, Fels
&amp; Company, of Philadelphia, had advertised it extensively
throughout a considerable period of time.</p>

<p>"Fitmeeasy", as applied to corsets, was considered
descriptive.</p>

<p>"Maltha" was refused registration for a brand of paving
asphalt. It appears that "Maltha" means liquid asphalt
and is in general use in the trade with that meaning.</p>

<p>"Elastic Seam", a name used to designate drawers having
an elastic seam at the side, is purely descriptive, and was
so considered by the court in the case of <cite>Scriven v North</cite>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the word "Elastic", when applied to
bookcases, is held to be a fanciful word, not descriptive, and
is a valid trade-mark.</p>

<p>Application was made by a brewer for the registration
of the word "Star", accompanied by a picture of a six-pointed
star, as a trade-mark for beer. Opposition by another
brewer was filed, and it was shown that both the
word "Star" and the symbol had been used for ages in
Germany, the home of beer, as a general sign of the brewing
business, in the same sense that a striped pole denotes a
barber. It was claimed, and the claim was judicially sustained,
that both the word "Star" and its symbol are indicative
of the brewing business in general and, as such, are
common to the trade, and cannot therefore be considered
valid trade-marks for beer.</p>

<p>A flour manufacturer conceived the idea of selling his
product in barrels made by staves of alternately light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dark wood&mdash;striped barrels, in fact. He then desired registration
for a trade-mark which consisted of a pictorial representation
of this form of barrel. It was held that this mark
was not registrable, as it was descriptive of the barrel.</p>

<p>"Better than Mother's" Mince Meat was held to be
invalid as a trade-mark, as it is obviously indicative of
quality.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><em>A complicated and involved

</div>

<p>A descriptive word in a foreign
language cannot be exclusively, appropriated
as a trade-mark. The
word "Matzoon" in Armenian
means "fermented milk". It was
held, in the case of <cite>Dadirrian v
Yacubian</cite> that this word, applied
to a preparation of fermented milk,
was not a valid trade-mark.</p>

<p>Arbitrary symbols, numbers or words in common use in
any line of trade to designate grades, or varieties, of products,
are held to have become descriptive by usage. "Lake",
"Cylinder", and "New York" are trade names used to indicate
qualities of glass. They were refused registration on
the ground that they were descriptive appellatives. Note
that one of the names, "New York", would have been considered
invalid on the ground of being a geographical term.</p>

<p>"A No. 1", "A X No. 1" and "No. 1", used by a plow
manufacturer to indicate size and shape of plows, were considered
descriptive terms, and, therefore, not valid trade-marks.</p>

<p>While descriptive numbers cannot be registered as trade-marks,
it is permitted to register numbers that are used as
arbitrary symbols. A celebrated instance of a number used
as a trade-mark is "4711" used to designate a line of toilet
articles. When the manufacture of the famous "4711" Perfume
began, the owner's place of business was at 4711
Glockengasse, in Cologne. The street number "4711" was
placed on the label, and it is to-day one of the oldest
trade-marks in existence, having been used for about one
hundred and twenty-five years. The house at 4711 Glockengasse
has long since disappeared, and "4711" is now only
an arbitrary symbol.</p>

<p>A manufacturer of hooks and eyes applied for registration
of the phrase "Rust? Never!" as a trade-mark. Registration
was refused, as the mark was held to be descriptive, indicating
that the hooks and eyes would never rust.</p>

<p>It should be noted that there are valid trade-marks that
seem to be descriptive, and which no doubt convey to the
purchaser the suggestion of quality, but which are not really
descriptive, but merely suggestive.
An example of this is "Hydegrade"
as applied to fabrics. This word is a
combination of "Hyde" (the name
of the proprietor) and "Grade". The
word, by virtue of its sound, brings
to the mind the idea of "high-grade"&mdash;a
very fortuitous circumstance,

<p>Names, descriptive in their nature, and therefore not
registrable under the Act of 1905, may, nevertheless, be
protected by the law of unfair competition, if the circumstances
are such as clearly to indicate that a new user of the
name has adopted it for the purpose of trading upon the
reputation of an older or more widely known concern.</p>


<h3 id="Section_31">A Trade-Mark Must Not Misrepresent
the Quality, Composition, Character,
or Origin of the Product</h3>

<p>A fraud cannot be legalized, and a misrepresentation of
any kind, made by a trade-mark, renders it invalid.</p>

<p>"Syrup of Figs" was held to be invalid as a trade-mark,
and not protectable, in a case where the product was shown
to have only a trace of fig syrup.</p>

<p>The title "American Sardines", applied to fish which
were not sardines, was considered a misrepresentation, and
was refused registration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(Note: Even if not a misrepresentation, it would be considered
invalid, as it is descriptive.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of <cite>Wrisley v Iowa Soap Company</cite>, it was
held that the name "Old Country Soap" used on soap and
advertised in such a way as to lead people to believe that it
was made in Europe, was deceptive and protection to the
name could not be given.</p>

<p>An interesting case is that of
<cite>Memphis Keeley Institute v Leslie
E. Keeley Co.</cite> (144 Fed. R. 628;
155 id. 964).</p>

<p>The Memphis Keeley Institute
made a contract with the Leslie E.
Keeley Company to represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Keeley Company in Tennessee in treating inebriates. The
Keeley Company agreed to sell the Keeley Cure to no one
in Tennessee except through the Memphis Institute.</p>

<p>After a while the Keeley Company claimed that the
Memphis Institute had violated its contract, and refused to
furnish any more of the treatment to the Memphis concern.</p>

<p>The Memphis Institute continued to advertise itself as
the representative of the Keeley Company, and to assert that
its treatment was that of the Keeley Company.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A coined word used

</div>

<p>Suit being brought, the Memphis Institute alleged that
the complainant's representations of
the ingredients of its remedies were
untrue and misleading. The Keeley
Company had extensively advertised
its treatment as the "Gold Cure".
It was shown in court that it contained no gold in any
form; that in the beginning chloride of gold had been
used in one instance, and that it had almost killed the patient;
and that special bottles of the cure had been prepared with
gold in them in order that a chemist might be deceived; and
that this chemist's analysis of the spurious
bottles had been extensively advertised
as showing that gold was in the
remedy.</p>

</div>

<p>On the evidence of these misrepresentations,
the Court of Appeals reversed
the decision of the lower court, and dismissed
the complaint.</p>

<p>The doctrine of law that misrepresentation
is a bar to protection of a trade-mark or a trade-name
has been clearly established by many decisions similar
to the above.</p>


<h3 id="Section_32">A Trade-Mark Must Not Be
Similar to a Trade-Mark previously
Registered for the same
Class of Merchandise</h3>

<p>When a pictorial or symbolic device has been registered,
registration is refused to any other mark, for the same class
of merchandise, composed of words describing the pictorial
or symbolic device already registered. Or, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>, if the
wording has been registered first, a symbol with the same
meaning will be denied registration. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>A trade-mark consisting of the conventional representation
of a fox, unaccompanied by lettering, would not be a
valid trade-mark if the word "Fox" had already been
registered for the same class of merchandise. In either case
the goods would be called the "Fox" brand.</p>

<p>The practice is to refuse registration of a mark in cases
where, although there may be no literal similarity, there is
a similarity in ideas.</p>

<p>"Edelweiss-Maltine" was refused registration on the
ground that it conflicted with "Maltine", a trade-mark
already registered for goods of the same description.</p>

<p>"Certosa" was refused registration as a trade-mark for
flour on account of its similarity to the word "Ceresota" already
registered.</p>

<p>The Patent Office has held that in an interference between
two trade-marks, one consisting of the pictorial representation
of a bouquet of flowers, and the other consisting of
the word "Bouquet", applied to the same class of goods,
that the marks were identical in meaning.</p>

<p>"Nassac" having been registered as a trade-mark, the
word "Nayassett" was refused registration on the ground
of similarity. Thereupon, the owner of the "Nayassett"
mark obtained the consent of the owners of "Nassac" to the
registration of "Nayassett". This did not alter the case, in
the opinion of the Commissioner of Patents, who held that
the law was mandatory, and was not affected by agreement
among the owners of conflicting marks.</p>

<p>In the case of <cite>McLean Co. v Adams Co.</cite> (136 Official
Gazette, 440) it was held that there was no conflict between
"Victoria" and "Victor", a mark already registered for the
same class of merchandise. A picture of Queen Victoria's
head was shown on a medallion, associated with the word
"Victoria". The "Victor" trade-mark consisted of the
words "The Victor" with a device showing a knight on
horseback. As the similarity between the marks was
obviously slight and superficial, and was outweighed by the
dissimilar features, it was held that the "Victoria" trade-mark
was entitled to registration.</p>

<p>It was held that there was no conflict between two
trade-marks for stove polish, one consisting of the word
"Raven" with the representation of a raven sitting on a
limb of a tree, and the other consisting of the word "Crow"
associated with a picture of a crow, also perched on a limb,
but in a different position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In case of conflicting marks the test of similarity is
whether the marks are sufficiently alike in sound or in
appearance, or in intention, to mislead the purchaser.</p>


<h3 id="Section_34">A Trade-Mark May
Not Be a Geographical
Name or Term</h3>

<p>The object of this provision of the law is to prohibit
the appropriation of the name of a place by an individual to
the detriment of other manufacturers in the same locality,
as well as to prevent a misrepresentation of the place of
origin of a trade-marked article.</p>

<p>This restriction does not apply to geographical names
used in an arbitrary or fanciful sense.</p>

<p>The Fleischman Company, well-known bakers of New
York, bake and sell a
Vienna Bread. The term
"Vienna" used in this
connection was held, in
a test case, to be a valid
trade-mark, although it
is a geographical name.</p>

<p>In the decision bearing
on the Vienna trade-mark
for bread, the Court said:
"As a mark for bread it
is purely arbitrary, and
is in no manner descriptive
of the ingredients or
the quality of the article.
No deception is practised,
because the place of its
manufacture is given, and
it is known that bread
cannot be imported from
abroad for use here."</p>

<p>"Durham", a name applied to tobacco, has been judicially
held not to be a valid trade-mark against another manufacturer
located in the town of Durham. While any tobacco
manufacturer in Durham has a right to call his tobacco
"Durham Tobacco", he cannot imitate the label of the
original Durham tobacco, or use the advertising symbol of
a bull, without being liable to injunction and a suit under
the law of unfair competition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"French", applied to paints, was considered a geographical
name, and not valid as a trade-mark. "French Tissue"&mdash;the
name of a court-plaster&mdash;was considered invalid, the
first word being a geographical term and the second a
descriptive word.</p>

<p>The word "Celtic", however, has been considered valid
as a trade-mark for tea. The Commissioner of Patents,
before whom the case went on an appeal, decided that while
"Grecian", "Roman" and "Oriental" had been held to be
geographical, as each of these terms refers to a certain section
of the globe, the word "Celtic" is not. There seems
to be no authority to sustain the popular opinion that "Celtic"
refers only to Ireland. The dictionary defines "Celtic"
as "pertaining to the Celts", of whom the Irish are only a
branch. It has never been applied to any specific locality.</p>

<p>"Yucatan" applied to leather; "Manhattan" as the name
of sewing-machines; and "Pittsburgh" as a trade-mark on
pumps, have all been held to be geographical, and therefore
invalid.</p>

<p id="Ref_35">In a recent decision of the Supreme Court, the exclusive
right of the Carthusian monks to use their well-known trade-mark
for their Liqueur Chartreuse, was upheld. This right
was attacked on the ground that Chartreuse is a geographical
name, the liqueur having been made at a monastery called
for many centuries "La Grande Chartreuse".</p>

<p>In his opinion Mr. Justice Hughes said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If it be assumed that the monks took their name from the region
in France in which they settled in the eleventh century, it still remains
true that it became peculiarly their designation. And the
word 'Chartreuse', as applied to the liqueur, which for generations
they made and sold, cannot be regarded in a proper sense as a
geographical name. It had exclusive reference to the fact that it
was the liqueur made by the Carthusian monks at their monastery.
So far as it embraced the notion of place, the description was not of
district, but of the monastery of the order&mdash;the abode of the
monks&mdash;and the term, in its entirety, pointed to production by the monks."</p></blockquote>

<p>While a geographical name may be upheld as a valid
trade-mark, under exceptional conditions&mdash;as shown in the
Fleischman case&mdash;the safe plan to follow is to avoid names
of this character when selecting a trade-mark.</p>

<p>Under the collection of legal precedents constituting the
law of unfair trade, the owner of a geographical trade-mark
may successfully defend his right to its exclusive use if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
has acquired such a reputation under it that it has grown
to be, in the public mind, an arbitrary designation of his
goods.</p>

<p>The American Waltham Watch Company, manufacturing
watches at Waltham, Massachusetts, has legally prevented
other manufacturers in Waltham from calling their
product "Waltham" watches unless the name is used with
some accompanying statement which clearly distinguishes
these watches from the original Waltham watch.</p>

<p>There is an Elgin Watch, a Kalamazoo Stove and a
Bristol Fishing-Rod, to single out a few examples of geographical
terms used as trade-marks. The exclusive use of
these trade-marks by the makers of the well-known articles
which they represent can no doubt be legally sustained on
the ground that these names have become arbitrarily identified,
through years of use and extensive distribution, with
the articles to which they are applied, and that their indiscriminate
use would cause confusion in the public mind and
loss to the original owners.</p>

<p>Their security as trade-marks rests, not upon the letter
of the trade-mark act, but upon the law of unfair trade.</p>


<h3 id="Section_36">A Trade-Mark Must
Not Consist of the
Insignia of the American
National Red Cross</h3>

<p>The Act of 1905 (the trade-mark statute) is silent on
the subject of the Red Cross as a trade-mark. Its use
as a trade-mark, or as an advertisement, or in trade in any
form, is prohibited by the act incorporating the American
National Red Cross, approved January 5, 1905. An extract
from this act, bearing on this subject, is quoted here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation, other than
the Red Cross of America, not now lawfully entitled to use the sign
of the Red Cross, hereafter to use such sign or any insignia colored
in imitation thereof for the purposes of trade, or as an advertisement
to induce the sale of any article whatsoever. If any person violates
the provisions of this section, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and shall be liable to a fine of not less than one nor more than five
hundred dollars, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year,
or both, for each and every offense. The fine so collected shall be
paid to the American National Red Cross."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Official Gazette there is reported the case of an
applicant who applied for registration of a label for cough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
syrup, containing the emblem of the Red Cross and the
words "Red Cross". This label having been refused registration,
the applicant submitted it in an amended form with
the Red Cross emblem left out, but with the wording left
intact. It was contended by him that the Act of January 5,
1905, prohibited only the use of the "sign of the Red Cross",
and that by implication the words "Red Cross" should be
considered registrable. This contention of the applicant
was held by the Commissioner to be an attempt to evade the
spirit of the law, and registration was refused.</p>

<p>A trade-mark containing the Red Cross emblem does
not fall within the prohibition expressed in the statute if it
has been in exclusive use by the applicant for ten years prior
to 1905.</p>


<h3 id="Section_37">A Trade-Mark Must Not Be
Merely the Name of an Individual,
Firm, Corporation, or
Association unless said
Name is Written, Printed,
Impressed or Woven, in some
Particular or Distinctive
Manner, or is Used in Connection
with the Portrait
of the Individual</h3>

<p>A surname cannot be the exclusive property of an individual,
because there may be other persons who have an
equal right to use the same name. A man by the name of
Jones may go into the business of manufacturing cigars, for
example, and he may call his product "Jones Cigars" and,
by his industry and ability, create a valuable business.</p>

<p>But any other Jones has a right to manufacture and sell
cigars, if he feels so inclined, and the first Jones cannot
prevent it. It is true that, under the law of unfair trade,
he may compel all other Joneses to mark their cigars in
<em>some distinctive manner</em>, in order that purchasers may not
be misled into the belief that they are buying the product
of the original Jones, when such is not the case.</p>

<p>This principle is specifically illustrated in the famous
Walter Baker cases, of which a brief resumé is given in
another chapter.</p>

<p>An obvious intent of the framers of the Act of 1905 was
to discourage the use of the names of "individuals, firms,
corporations and associations" as trade-marks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently, it was provided in the act that names of
this character should not be registered unless they were
"written, printed, impressed or woven in some particular or
distinctive manner, or used in connection with the portrait
of the individual."</p>

<p>The ruling of the Patent Office, which has been sustained
by the courts, is that the particular or distinctive
manner of presenting the name must exhibit a peculiarity
so pronounced that it dominates the name, and throws it
into relatively secondary importance. In other words, a
trade-mark of this character, to be registrable, must possess
more of the quality of a device than of a name.</p>

<p>It is conceded that an autograph signature, like "Wilcox's",
shown on this page, is entitled to registration.</p>

<p>Soon after the law went into effect a curious tangle
developed in the application of this feature of the act.</p>

<p>It was found that the Patent Office&mdash;and its stand was
upheld by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia&mdash;would
not sanction the registration of a name possessing
all the technical requisites of a valid trade-mark if it happened
to be the name of the applicant, unless it was written
or printed in some particular and distinctive form.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>Written in a "particular
and distinctive
manner" within the
meaning of the law.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>To a legal mind there may have been some good reason
for this attitude of the court, but a
layman of ordinary common sense can
find nothing in the statute that would
justify a refusal to register a trade-mark,
valid in other respects, merely
because it happened to be the name of
the person, corporation, or firm making
the application.</p>

<p>The name "Success", a valid mark in every essential
respect, was refused registration as a trade-mark for Success
Magazine, because it formed part of the name of the applicant,
The Success Magazine Company.</p>

<p>The ruling of the court left the implication that if Success
Magazine had been published by John Brown &amp; Co.,
or by any other concern other than the Success Magazine
Company, registration would have been granted. It was
held that a registration of the name "Success" would be a
violation of that provision of the law providing that a mark
consisting merely of the name of the applicant could not be
registered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The word "Champion", as a trade-mark for locks, was
rejected by the Patent Office on the ground that it formed
part of the name of the Champion Safety Lock Company.
The word "Champion" is arbitrary and fanciful, and could
no doubt have been registered by any other firm than the
Champion Safety Lock Company.</p>

<p>Many other similar cases developed during the first
six years of the law's application. This situation led to
the passage on February 8, 1911, of the following amendment
of this section of the Act of 1905:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Provided</em>, further that nothing herein shall
prevent the registration of a trade-mark otherwise
registrable because of its being the name of the
applicant or a portion thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is now practicable to register the name of any individual,
firm, corporation or association&mdash;even if it is the
name of the applicant&mdash;provided it is "written, printed, impressed
or woven, in some particular or distinctive manner."</p>

shade roller, where
the name "Stewart Hartshorn",

used for many years. The name "Huyler's", applied to
confectionery, is another case of the same kind.</p>

the most valuable trade-mark in the department store

any Foreign Nation</h3>

<p>It has been decided in one case where an application was
made to register the coat of arms of Maryland, that it could
not be registered even under the ten years' clause.</p>

<p>Simulations of the coat of arms of the United States, or
of the United States flag, have been denied registration.</p>

<p>The U. S. Sanitary Manufacturing Co. was refused
registration for a trade-mark consisting of the letters "U. S."
with a background of a shield similar to that of the conventional
United States shield.</p>

<p>In the case of Popoff Frères, importers, registration of
a mark including the Russian coat of arms was refused,
although proof was shown that the Russian government
had authorized the applicants to use this coat of arms as
their trade-mark. The Commissioner held that the law
could not be set aside by agreement.</p>

<p>The reader is doubtless familiar with the trade-mark of
the United Cigar Stores&mdash;a shield consisting of a background
at the top with the word "Cigars" on it, with the
word "United" forming the lower part of the design. The
vertical lines form seven heavy strokes, corresponding to the
seven red stripes in the American flag. This design is
suggestive of the United States coat of arms, but it is so
cleverly worked out that it does not come within the prohibition
expressed in the law. Suggestive as this design is
of the American shield, this feature is secondary, after all,
for the design is dominated by the lettering "United" and
"Cigars."</p>


<h3 id="Section_40b">A Trade-Mark Must Not
Be a Form, a Color, a
Shape, or a Material</h3>

<p>It is clear that a trade-mark must be a "mark"&mdash;not a
box, or an envelope, or container of any kind. In a case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
where it was sought to register a drum-shaped box used to
contain "Drum Collars", it was held that, "if such claims
were allowed, the forms and materials of packages to contain
articles and merchandise would be rapidly taken up,
and appropriated by dealers, until some one bolder than the
others, might go to the very root of things, and claim the
primitive brown paper and tow strings."</p>

<p>A product itself cannot be registered as a trade-mark, for
the "mark" must be different and separate from the thing
marked.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to give an exclusive right to use

<p>A fountain pen manufacturer was
refused registration for a trade-mark
for fountain pens, consisting of a red feed bar contrasted
with a black reservoir of hard rubber. The applicant
stated that the feed bar was colored red in the manufacturing
process, and that it was composed of rubber
made by a special formula. The Court of Appeals held
that registration of this device would give the applicant a
virtual monopoly of this feature.</p>

<p>The Underwood Typewriter Co. applied for registration
of the face-plate of their machine as a trade-mark. It is a
principle of the trade-mark law that a part of a machine,
or the form of an article, cannot be a valid trade-mark.
Reporting this case, the Bulletin of the United States Trade-mark
Association for January, 1908, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The applicant, in the instance under adjudication, sought to
avoid this principle of law, by contending that the case did not
fall within that doctrine, for the reason that the plate which he
sought to register was not really a part of the machine, since it could
be removed without changing the shape of the machine, or interfering
with its operation, or altering its structure. It was held, however,
that while the plate performed none of the mechanical functions of
the machine it was nevertheless a part of the machine as actually
constructed, and was as essential as the frame itself to the production
of a commercial article. It was necessary to give a finished
appearance to the machine, which would not be salable without it.
To recognize the applicant's right to a trade-mark in that feature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the machine, would enable the applicant to prevent the manufacture
of its machines as constructed to-day, after all the patents covering
it had expired, since no salable machine could be produced without
infringing the trade-mark."</p></blockquote>


<h3 id="Section_42">Trade-Marks Are Not

<p>The common good takes precedence of the rights of
individuals. This is a principle of equity which has run

We find it developed into diverse and widely separated forms.
On one hand, it appears as the right of eminent domain; in
another form we find it appearing in a law prohibiting the

<p>This principle is observed by the Patent Office and the

facsimile signature of the late Ex-President Grover Cleveland
as a trade-mark was refused, the Commissioner of
Patents holding that the use of a trade-mark of this character
would detract from the dignity of the high office of
President.</p>

<p>The portrait and facsimile signature of Thomas Jefferson
was refused registration on the same grounds.</p>

<p>It should be noted that there is no law to prevent any
manufacturer desirous of using the name and portrait of an
Ex-President (not living) as a trade-mark if he cares to do
so, but <em>he cannot register such a trade-mark</em>, and his ability
to protect it in the courts in case of infringement is conjectural.</p>

<p>The word "Copyright", the name of a brand of flour,
was refused registration on the ground that its registration
would be opposed to public policy, since its use in connection
with the phrase "Registered in the United States Patent
Office" would be likely to impress buyers with the idea that
the flour had been approved officially. It was also stated by
the Commissioner, before whom the application went on
appeal, that its registration might be used to annoy other
flour manufacturers, who are obliged by law to give notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of copyright on their labels, by using the word "Copyright"
with the date and name of the owner.</p>

<p>The R. M. Rose Company was refused registration for
the words "Ask the Revenue Officer" as a trade-mark for
whiskey. The objection is that this trade-mark might lead
purchasers to believe that the quality of the whiskey thus
branded has the approval of the government.</p>

<p>For the same reason the word "Government" was refused
registration as a trade-mark for loose-leaf binders.</p>

<p>A trade-mark that is not affixed to the goods for which
it is registered cannot be protected in the courts.</p>

<p><em>A mark, or design, or name, that is used only in advertising

is an essential requisite of validity in trade-marks.</p>

</div>

<p>The trade-mark may be
written, or printed, or pasted,
or stenciled, or branded, or
woven, or sewed, upon the article
with which it is used.</p>

<p>When it is not feasible to
affix it to the article itself, as in
case of liquids and many other
commodities, the trade-mark must be affixed to the container.</p>

<p>Many ingenious devices are used by manufacturers in
affixing trade-marks. The trade-mark "Brenlin", on Brenlin
window shades, is placed upon every yard of the fabric
in small perforated letters. The name appears near the selvage
on each side of the goods.</p>

<p>The name "Aurora", applied to portieres and similar
hangings, is to be found woven in the pattern of the fabric
near the ends of each piece. The trade-mark blends into
the pattern in such a way that it is inconspicuous, but may
be readily found upon looking for it.</p>

<p>The London Feather Company's "London Plumes"
trade-mark is cleverly affixed, being in the shape of a
diminutive celluloid label, to the inside of the stem of each
ostrich plume. The label is sewed on in such a manner that
if it is cut out the plume falls apart.</p>

</div>

<p>Makers of clothing
generally affix their trade-marks
to each garment
in the shape of a sewed
label. Manufacturers of
rubber goods, such as rubber tires, water bags, etc., mold
the trade-mark into the article itself. The "Lowell Duck"
trade-mark, used on sail cloth, is stenciled at regular intervals
on the selvage. The Corticelli kitten, which is the registered
trade-mark of Corticelli Spool Silk, appears on the label at
the end of each spool.</p>

<p>Moet &amp; Chandon, and other champagne producers, have
adopted the unique method of affixing their trade-marks to
the bottom of the corks of their bottles. The trade-mark is
not seen, of course, until the bottle has been opened. This
method of affixation has been sustained by the courts. The
logic of it is that it prevents an unscrupulous retailer from
washing the label off a bottle of wine and pasting a spurious
label in its place, provided the purchaser knows where to look
for the trade-mark.</p>

<h2><span class="mediumfont">CHAPTER III</span><br />

Advertising Characters</h2>

<p class="dropcap">The main difference between a trade-mark and an
"advertising character" is in the matter of affixation.
A trade-mark, to be valid, must be affixed to the
goods, while an advertising character is often used only in
the advertisements of the product, though most advertisers
use their trade-marks also in advertising.</p>

<p>But there is another difference. A trade-mark is inflexible.
After having been once adopted and registered, it
cannot be changed in design or wording. If changes are
made in it, the validity of the trade-mark is vitiated proportionately.
On the other hand, all kinds of changes are
being constantly made in advertising characters, though
advertisers are careful to preserve the main features of a
character, after having adopted it, in order that it may be
the touchstone of remembrance in the reader's mind.</p>

<p>It has occurred to various advertisers, who have been
impressed by the infinite variety of pictures in advertising,
that it would be a good idea for them to put some permanent
pictorial feature in their advertisements. This feature&mdash;a
human figure, or a decoration, or a group of figures&mdash;serves
as an identifying landmark to the voyager in these
weltering seas of change. With this principle established
and followed year after year in all advertisements of any
product, it is feasible to change the entire artistic treatment
of the subject from time to time, yet still hold to the symbolic
figures which connect, in the reader's mind, all the past
advertising with the new series.</p>

<p>This line of reasoning underlies the adoption and use of
advertising characters.</p>

<p>An "advertising character"&mdash;this is a rather crude term,
but it seems to express the idea better than anything else&mdash;differs
from an advertising illustration in that the character
is carried on continuously in the advertising, in some form,
while an illustration is dropped for something new.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>Peter Henderson's
famous gardener.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>For example, Peter Henderson's gardener
appears, and has appeared, in every
advertisement of Peter Henderson's seeds
for many years. In most of the Peter
Henderson advertisements, the gardener is
the only illustration.</p>

<p>The Lackawanna Railroad has used
Phoebe Snow for many years in its advertisements
as its star passenger on the
dirtless and dustless road to Buffalo. The
scheme of picturing this dainty white-clad
girl in connection with the advertising of
a railroad is based on a very clever idea.
Railroad journeys are generally supposed
to be dusty and uncomfortable; but here is an attractive
young lady who does not even go to the trouble of changing
her white dress when she makes a trip on the Lackawanna.
The use of Phoebe Snow as an advertising symbol is suggestive
of the cleanliness and comfort and safety of the
road.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>The Dutch boy is taken out of

</div>

<p>It sometimes happens that an advertising character is a
figure or a device that has been formally adopted as a trade-mark
of the advertiser's product. The National Lead
Company's Dutch painter boy is a device of this kind.
While a trade-mark must not be changed, a human figure,
used as the trade-mark, may be put into another illustration,
and used separately. This
has been done in the National
Lead Company's advertising.
Their Dutch Boy has been depicted
in the act of painting a
house, and in giving a lecture on
paint.</p>

<p>The Gold Dust Twins have
been engaged in laborious but
joyous tasks of various kinds
since about 1880. Gold Dust
was first made in 1883, but the
twins, not called at that time
"The Gold Dust Twins" had
been a house trade-mark of the
N. K. Fairbank Company for
two or three years before that.</p>

<p>One of the most widely known symbols ever used in
advertising is the representation of the Rock of Gibraltar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which is a feature of the Prudential Insurance Company's
advertising. There is hardly any doubt that pictures of the
Rock have been printed more times in connection with the
Prudential advertising than in all other forms of representation
that have been issued since the art of printed illustration
began.</p>

<p>The conception of the Victor dog, with his head inclined
in a curiously suggestive listening attitude, before the mouthpiece
of a phonograph, with the caption, "His Master's

the productions of genius. It
would be interesting to know
what the Victor Talking Machine
Company thinks its dog is
worth.</p>

<p>The American Bankers' Association,
which issues travelers'
cheques, good in every part of the world, has adopted a
couple of travelers&mdash;evidently a young man and his wife on
their honeymoon trip&mdash;as advertising characters. This well-groomed
couple is shown, in the various advertisements, on
the deck of a steamship, before the Pyramids,
in a Venetian gondola, buying
curios in the Orient, and in other places.
Before they settle down they will have
covered as many leagues as the Wandering
Jew.</p>

<p>The Dutch Cleanser woman, in her
eternal chase of dirt, is one of the best-known
advertising characters in current
use. This character is also the trade-mark
of the product, and appears on cans
of Dutch Cleanser.</p>

<p>It would be hard to beat this Dutch
Cleanser woman as an eye-catcher. She
shows motion, energy in action, and the
device has an attractive simplicity.</p>

</div>

<p>An Alpine mountaineer, used as an advertising character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of Peter's Chocolate, has become well-known to every magazine
reader in the country. The use of this figure harmonizes
with the phrase "high as the Alps in quality", which is used
in the Peter's Chocolate advertising.</p>

<p>The advantage to be gained, in the long run, by adopting
a catchy and attractive advertising character, is shown by
the nation-wide popularity of the Campbell "Kids". Everybody
knows them and their rippling jingles, and they have
no doubt become immensely valuable to the concern that
owns them.</p>

<p>The law of unfair competition
protects an advertiser in the use of
an advertising character when the
character is the advertiser's own creation.</p>

<p>In cases where living models are
used for this purpose, the advertiser
should remember that a model has a
right to sell his services&mdash;that is, to
pose&mdash;for anybody he pleases. Some
advertisers make a contract of long
duration with the models they intend
to use, binding them to an agreement
not to pose for any other commercial
purpose.</p>

<p>Catch-phrases used in advertising,
like Ivory Soap's famous "It Floats",
and Bon Ami's "Hasn't Scratched
Yet" are protectable against infringement and unauthorized
use by another than the owner, through the same principle of
law which gives protection to a manufacturer against a
competitor who has imitated his packages, labels and circulars.</p>

<p>An advertiser's exclusive right to a catch-phrase is conditional
on its constant and persistent use by him. An intermittent
use does not establish a right to use it to the
exclusion of others, nor does a use of the phrase in varying
forms of wording, even if the sense of it is preserved,
establish such a right.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that an exclusive right cannot
be created for a phrase that is not distinctive, such as
"Your Opportunity", "Clip the Coupon", etc. The common
language is free to all, and an advertiser cannot prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
others from using a phrase in their advertisements
merely because he used it in his advertisements
first, unless he can prove that they
are using his language with the intention of
misleading the public.</p>

<p>In the case of the unauthorized use of a
well-known, extensively advertised catch-phrase,
this intention is virtually obvious.
For example, if any soap manufacturer
should begin to print the N. K. Fairbank
Company's celebrated question, "Have You
a little Fairy in your Home?" in his advertisements
and signs, the courts would doubtless
enjoin him summarily, without inquiry
into his intentions. This phrase has been
used so long by the N. K. Fairbank Co.,
and so much money has been expended in
giving it publicity, that its owners have acquired a valuable
property right in it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Money invested in advertising is as much a
part of a business as if invested in buildings or
machinery, and when the goods of a manufacturer
have become popular, not only because of
their intrinsic worth, but also by reason of the
ingenious, attractive and persistent manner in
which they have become advertised, the good-will
thus created is entitled to protection against unfair
competition." (<cite>Hilson v Foster</cite>, 80 Fed. R.
896&mdash;1897.)</p></blockquote>

<p>An interesting case of one concern attempting
to profit by the advertising of
another, was in the courts in 1907.</p>

<p>Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes were
extensively advertised in a series of
"blind" advertisements in newspapers on
successive days. These advertisements,
which were of large size and striking in
appearance, showed the picture of a
woman winking, with the admonition
"Wink at Your Grocer and See What
You Will Get", followed by the letters
"K. T. C." in large type. The idea of
the advertiser was to arouse curiosity by
this form of advertising, and particularly
by the letters "K. T. C." After considerable
advertising of this kind he had planned to announce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that "K. T. C." meant "Kellogg's
Toasted Corn Flakes", and that any
woman might get a package of this
preparation free if she would wink at
her grocer.</p>

<p>But before the final explanatory
advertisements appeared, another concern
selling "Cook's Flaked Rice", a
similar product, caused advertisements
to be printed in the same newspapers, in
which they announced that "K. T. C."
meant "Keep to Cook's".</p>

<p>The Central Railroad of New Jersey,
in advertising its New York to Philadelphia service, uses a
phrase that is a complete advertisement of its train service
in six words. Trains leave New
York for Philadelphia every
hour, leaving at ten o'clock,
eleven o'clock, at noon, and so
on. Every train leaves exactly
on the hour.</p>

<p>The road formerly used the
phrase: "Trains every hour on
the hour", and this seemed to be
pretty good, but it was thought that something better might
be devised. A great deal of thought was given to the subject,
and as a result the phrase "Your Watch Is Your Time
Table" was devised. This phrase tells the whole story. It
is no longer necessary to bother with time-tables when one
goes from New York to Philadelphia. Just look at your
watch. To visualize this idea, the phrase is used in the advertising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in connection with the pictures of a fast train and
a watch.</p>

<p>A celebrated advertising phrase was "You press the button;
we do the rest", formerly used by the Eastman Kodak
Company. This sentence achieved a tremendous popularity,
but it had the fundamental defect of not containing any
word which would connect it closely with the Eastman
Company's product. There is hardly a doubt that it was
heard and used by a vast number of people who did not
receive any Kodak-buying suggestion from it.</p>

<p>A short, incisive phrase which does not possess this defect
is "O'Sullivanize Your Walk", used in the advertising
of O'Sullivan's Rubber Heels. When you have a pair of
O'Sullivan's Heels put on your shoes you do not merely
invest in a comfort-giving device. It is a bigger transaction
than that. You begin to walk like a man who means business&mdash;you
have the erect and confident bearing of success&mdash;in
short, you "O'Sullivanize Your Walk".</p>

<h2><span class="mediumfont">CHAPTER IV</span><br />

Infringement</h2>

<p class="dropcap">There is no intrinsic value in a trade-mark. Its
worth in dollars is a creation, and it depends upon
the successful sale, or popularity, of the commodity
to which the trade-mark is applied, the distribution of this
commodity, the extent to which it has been advertised, and
the profit that there is in it.</p>

<p>Some widely-known trade-marks are worth millions of
dollars, and many are valued at a hundred thousand dollars
or more.</p>

<p>The ownership of an advertised and favorably known
trade-mark is, therefore, a valuable property right. In
estimating the assets of a business, its trade-mark is included
under the head of Good-Will, and Good-Will is
Reputation. The value of a trade-mark is the value of the
reputation of the goods it represents and identifies.</p>

<p>A valuable trade-mark&mdash;like other valuable things&mdash;becomes,
sooner or later, an object of envy on the part of
those who want money without troubling themselves about
the manner of getting it. Sometimes this leads to a more
or less ingenious simulation of a trade-mark.</p>

<p>The remedy for the infringement of a registered trade-mark
is covered by sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of the Act
of 1905. We quote these sections of the law:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sec. 16. That the registration of a trade-mark
under the provisions of this act shall be
prima facie evidence of ownership. Any person
who shall, without the consent of the owner thereof,
reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate
any such trade-mark and affix the same to
merchandise of substantially the same descriptive
properties as those set forth in the registration,
or to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, or
receptacles intended to be used upon or in connection
with the sale of merchandise of substantially
the same descriptive properties as those set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forth in such registration, and shall use, or shall
have used, such reproduction, counterfeit, copy
or colorable imitation in commerce among the
several states, or with a foreign nation, or with
the Indian tribes, shall be liable to an action for
damages therefor at the suit of the owner thereof;
and whenever in any such action a verdict is
rendered for the plaintiff, the court may enter
judgment therein for any sum above the amount
found by the verdict as the actual damages, according
to the circumstances of the case, not
exceeding three times the amount of such verdict,
together with the costs.</p>

<p>"Sec. 17. That the Circuit and Territorial
Courts of the United States and the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia shall have
original jurisdiction, and the Circuit Courts of
Appeal of the United States and the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia shall have
appellate jurisdiction of all suits at law or in
equity respecting trade-marks registered in accordance
with the provisions of this act, arising
under the present act, without regard to the
amount in controversy.</p>

<p>"Sec. 18. That writs of certiorari may be
granted by the Supreme Court of the United
States for the review of cases arising under this
act in the same manner as provided for patent
cases by the act creating the Circuit Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p>"Sec. 19. That the several courts vested with
jurisdiction of cases arising under the present act
shall have power to grant injunctions, according
to the course and principles of equity, to prevent
the violation of any right of the owner of a
trade-mark registered under this act, on such
terms as the court may deem reasonable; and
upon a decree being rendered in any such case
for wrongful use of a trade-mark the complainant
shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the
profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the
damages the complainant has sustained thereby,
and the court shall assess the same or cause the
same to be assessed under its direction. The
court shall have the same power to increase such
damages, in its discretion, as is given by section
sixteen of this act for increasing damages found
by verdict in actions of law; and in assessing
profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove
defendant's sales only; defendant must prove all
elements of cost which are claimed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The legal remedies set forth in these sections of the Act
of 1905 apply only in case of infringements of registered
trade-marks. In the case of infringements of common law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
trade-marks, and in cases where packages, labels and advertisements
are imitated or counterfeited, actions to restrain
must be brought under the law of unfair trade.</p>

<p><em>A coined word is the property, in a commercial sense, of
the person, or firm, or corporation, that makes it up and
uses it.</em></p>

<p>This is indisputable. It is a principle of justice that is
supported consistently by the courts, but it needs no legal
mind to acquiesce in its fairness, for it appeals to everybody's
common-sense.</p>

<p>How far the use of a coined word may be allowed, when
applied by other persons than its owners to goods of a different
and non-competitive class, is a question that has not
been definitely settled. In England, the court enjoined the
use of the word "Kodak" as a name for bicycles. There is
little doubt that the unauthorized use of any widely-known
coined word, that has been nationally advertised, would be
enjoined by the courts, even if applied to a wholly different
line of merchandise.</p>

<p>A railroad cannot have a trade-mark in the true sense, inasmuch
as the business of transportation produces no product to which a
trade-mark can be affixed.</p>

<p>The advertising symbols of railroads stand in the relation of trade-marks,
and are protected by the common law against infringement.</p>

<p>A poorly-made and inferior article, even if it should
belong to a class of goods quite dissimilar to that of another
article of the same name, might indirectly bring discredit
upon the latter.</p>

<p>The word "Educator" was refused registration as a
trade-mark for fish, on the ground that as it had already been
registered as a trade-mark for a brand of biscuits, its use by
another might lead to confusion, although fish and biscuits
are quite dissimilar products.</p>

<p>There have been cases where a label, or a sign, or
a trade-name, or trade-mark, has been appropriated bodily
by a concern not entitled to use it. Some cases of infringement
of this character are given in H. D. Nims' instructive
book on "Unfair Business Competition," from which the
following example is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The defendants accumulated in the St. Louis market stoves
(not made by plaintiff) with the name 'Charter Oak' upon them,
which they held for sale as 'Charter Oak Stoves.' They were
aware of the plaintiff's proprietorship of the 'Charter Oak' trade-mark,
and were proceeding to sell in defiance of the plaintiff's
rights. Plaintiff had been the first to use 'Charter Oak' as a name
of a stove and had used it for a long time when this suit was begun.
The mark was not registered. Injunction granted." <cite>Filley v Fassett</cite>,
(44 Mo. 168&mdash;1869).</p></blockquote>

<p>Infringements are generally more subtle and clever than
a mere bodily adoption of a trade-mark. For instance, a
piratical trade-mark may be devised so nearly like a well-known
mark that it will readily deceive an unwary or
careless or ignorant purchaser, and yet be so different that
a show of defending it may be made.</p>

<p>Or, an entirely different trade-mark may be used, while
the size, shape and color of the package may be imitated.
The National Biscuit Company uses distinctive packages for
its products, and its trade-marks are, in most cases, original,
arbitrary, coined words, yet it has so far prosecuted approximately
five hundred suits for infringement of its marks and
packages.</p>

<p>"Uneeda Biscuit" has been infringed by "Iwanta Biscuit",
"Uwanta Biscuit" and "Ulika Biscuit", all of which were
enjoined. In the "Iwanta" case, the opinion of the court
was, in part, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Defendants present the usual voluminous bundle of affidavits by
persons in the trade to the effect that in their opinion no one is likely
to mistake defendant's biscuit for complainant's. As has been
pointed out before, it makes no difference that dealers in the article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
are not deceived. No one expects that they will be. It is the probable
experience of the consumer that the court considers. Here, too,
we have the manufacturer of the articles complained of, who explains,
as usual, that in adopting a trade-name by which to identify
his own product he has been most careful not to trespass upon any
rights of complainant, and that, after considerable thought, he selected
a name which should make the difference between his goods and
complainant's distinct and plain, so that there could be no possibility
of mistake. It is a curious fact that so many manufacturers of
proprietary articles, when confronted with some well-advertised trade-name
or mark of a rival manufacturer, seem to find their inventive
faculties so singularly unresponsive to their efforts to differentiate.
Thus, in one case, with the word 'Cottolene' before him, defendant's
best effort at differentiation resulted in 'Cottoleo'; and 'Mongolia'
seemed to another defendant entirely unlike 'Magnolia'. The manufacturer
of the articles which defendants in the case at bar are
selling seems to have had no better luck, for, with the word 'Uneeda'
before him, his device to avoid confusion was the adoption of the
word 'Iwanta'. The incessant use of the personal pronouns in daily
speech has associated in every one's mind the sounds represented by
the letter 'I' and 'U', the two words are of precisely the same length;
both end with the letter 'A', and both express the same idea, namely,
that the prospective purchaser's personal comfort would be promoted
by the acquisition of a biscuit.... Both name and dress are
clearly calculated to mislead, and the statements that both were
adopted with an eye single to differentiation strain the credulity of
the court beyond the breaking point."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of <cite>Lever Bros. v Smith</cite> (112 Fed. R. 998),
the complainant had built up a large and profitable sale for
"Welcome" soap. The defendant, Welcome A. Smith, put
on the market a soap similar in size and shape to "Welcome"
soap, and labeled it with his own name "Welcome A.
Smith", making the word "Welcome" on his labels large and
prominent, with "A" and "Smith" below it, and in much
smaller type. On the ends of the package the word "Welcome"
alone appeared. It was held that while Smith had
a right to use his own name, he could not use it in such a
way that it would suggest an identity between these two
products.</p>

<p>In the case of <cite>Swift v Brenner</cite>
(125 Fed. R. 826) it was held
that Swift &amp; Company's "Old
Mill Soap" which had a picture
of an old mill on the label, was
infringed by "Old Stone Mill
Soap", the label of which also had a picture of an old mill.</p>

<p>In the interesting case of the <cite>Welsbach Light Company
v Adam</cite> (107 Fed. R. 463) it was shown that the infringing
trade-mark had been devised before the complainant's mark,
but had not been used until after the complainant's mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had been registered. On Feb. 20, 1900, the complainant
(The Welsbach Light Company) registered the coined
word "Yusea," as a trade-mark applied to gas mantles.
Some months before this, the defendant had conceived the
name "U&mdash;C&mdash;A" with the idea of using it in connection
with gas mantles of his own manufacture. Its actual use
as a trade-mark was not begun, however, until after the
complainant's mark had been registered. On Oct. 23, 1900,
the defendant registered "U&mdash;C&mdash;A" as a trade-mark.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_063.png" width="200" height="86" alt="Huyler's" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>This mark stands for
quality in confectionery.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The complainant based his action
for an injunction against the use by
the defendant of the mark, "U&mdash;C&mdash;A"
on the ground that its resemblance
in sound to "Yusea" was sufficient to
confuse buyers and divert trade from
the complainant.</p>

<p>It was shown that "Yusea" is commonly pronounced
"You see a"; that purchasers, in asking dealers for these
mantles, called them "You See A" Mantles; and that the
pronunciation of the name of defendant's mantles was the
same as the name of complainant's products.</p>

<p>The defendant contended that there was no similarity
in appearance in the two names; that the similarity in sound
was only incidental; that there was no infringement, because
the name "U&mdash;C&mdash;A" had been devised prior to the conception
of "Yusea"; and that the registration of "U&mdash;C&mdash;A",
allowed by the Patent Office, was proof of dissimilarity.</p>

<p>The Court sustained the contention of the Welsbach
Light Company, and the use of "U&mdash;C&mdash;A" as a trade-mark
for gas mantles was enjoined on the ground that it was an
infringement of "Yusea."</p>

<p><em>Where there is a casual resemblance, not sufficiently
marked to deceive a person of ordinary judgment, there is
held to be no infringement.</em></p>

<p>A case in point was shown in the contention between the
manufacturers of the well-known "3 in 1" Oil and the
owners of a similar product called "Big Four". The "3 in
1" label bears a large figure "1" in red, enclosing the figure
"3" and the word "in". The defendant's label was of
different size, was printed partly in red and partly in black,
and was headed "Big Four". The figure "4" in black was
displayed prominently on a red background. No infringement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p><em>A trade-mark may be held to infringe another trade-mark
already established, even if it has no similarity in
sound or to the eye, but if there is a close similarity in ideas.</em></p>

<p>This is exemplified by a case recently, before the Federal
court for the Southern district of New York. The words
"Beats-All" have been used for a number of years as a trade-mark
for pencils. The owners of the "Beats-All" trade-mark
applied for an injunction against the use of "Knox-All"
as a trade-mark for pencils sold by a rival concern. The
defendant contended that "Beats-All" was a descriptive term,
indicating superiority, and, as such, it could not be protected
as a trade-mark. The complainant proved that he had used
the mark "Beats-All" for many years, and that, while it was
originally descriptive, long usage had given it a secondary
meaning. He also showed that he had registered this trade-mark
under the ten years' clause. The court held that the
registration of the mark under the ten years' clause removed
it from the class of descriptive phrases&mdash;in other words, that
registration under the ten years' clause was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i>
evidence of validity. The defendant claimed, that in any
case, "Knox-All" was so dissimilar to the ear and eye, there
was no infringement of "Beats-All". This view was not
sustained by the court, which held that a close similarity of
ideas was sufficient to constitute infringement.</p>

<p><em>From these, and other cases, it may be seen that a question
of whether a trade-mark has been infringed is sometimes
a question of psychology.</em></p>

<p>It is not necessary for the complainant to produce evidence
that buyers have been actually deceived. His case is
established when he can show that the marks, or symbols, or
packages, or general "get-up" of the goods are sufficiently
similar to establish a strong probability of deception.</p>

<p>The case of <cite>Shaw Stocking Company v Mack</cite> (21 Blatch
1&mdash;1882. C. C. N. Y.), cited by Mr. Nims, is an example of
infringement that seems to fall within the range of psychological
analysis.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Complainant manufactured at Lowell hosiery of high reputation
and designated one style by the figures '830'. The label bore the
trade-mark 'Shawknit' in script with a flourish and the words
'Seamless Half Hose,' with the name of the manufacturer and the
figures '830.'</p>

<p>"Defendants at Albany bought large quantities of complainant's
goods and with complainant's consent, in effect, held themselves out
to the public as selling agents of complainant's. They then began
to buy of a Connecticut manufacturer goods similar to complainant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
'830' style, but inferior, and sold them under a label generally resembling
complainant's in appearance and bearing the word 'Seamless'
in script of a similar style, including the flourish, followed by
the words 'Half Hose, Double Heels,' with defendant's name and
address, and the figures '830.'</p>

<p>"The court enjoined them from using the figures '830' to designate
the Connecticut goods, and from using on the label the word 'Seamless,'
printed in imitation of Shawknit."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the case given above there was no infringement of
the actual trade-mark. But the intent to deceive purchasers
was shown by the use of the style number 830 and by the
careful imitation of the general appearance. Well-informed
customers, looking for the trade-mark Shawknit, would not
have been deceived, but the probability of deceiving the
uninformed and careless was sufficient to justify the injunction.</p>

<p><em>It should be kept in mind that the term "infringement"
covers not only the imitation of a technical trade-mark, in
whole or in part, but embraces all violations of the rights of
others, in trade, no matter whether such violations fall under
the trade-mark law, or the law of unfair competition.</em></p>

<p>The noted case of <cite>McLean v Fleming</cite> (96 U. S. 245&mdash;1877)
decided in 1877, is one of the cases that underlie the
law of unfair competition. In this case the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nor is it necessary, in order to give a right
to an injunction, that a specific trade-mark should
be infringed; but it is sufficient that the court is
satisfied that there was an intent on the part of
the respondent to palm off his goods as the goods
of the complainant, and that he persists in doing
so after being requested to desist."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the gist of the whole matter of infringement. If
an effort to trade on the reputation of another can be proved,
irrespective of the form this effort may take, it is held to be
an infringement.</p>

<p>"Chatter-Box" is an old-established publication for children,
issued in the form of an illustrated book, once a year.
It was held that "Chatter-Book", a publication issued for the
same purpose, and of the same general appearance, was an
infringement.</p>

<p>A piano manufacturer by the name of Henshaw placed
upon the market a piano called the "Steinberg." It was
held by the Court that the name "Steinberg" was an infringement
of the name "Steinway," which had been long used as
the name of famous pianos.</p>

<p>In the case of <cite>Johnson &amp; Johnson v
Bauer &amp; Black</cite> (82 Fed. R. 662, reversing
79 Fed. R. 954) it was held that the complainant's
mark of a red Greek cross, used
on plasters, was infringed by the defendant's
mark of a Greek cross with a red circle in
the center, containing the letters "B &amp; B",
and used on the same class of goods.</p>

<p><em>A trade-mark adopted for a patented
article during the life of the patent, is held
to be descriptive of the article, and the right to its exclusive
use expires at the expiration of the patent.</em></p>

<p>The import of this far-reaching trade-mark doctrine is
illustrated in the celebrated Singer case.</p>

<p>The Singer Manufacturing Company, when the patents
on its sewing machine were about to expire, adopted as a
trade-mark the word "Singer" blended with a device. The
effect of this action, if the validity of the trade-mark had
been sustained, would have been to perpetuate the right to
the exclusive use of the word "Singer" as applied to sewing
machines. In this event, at the expiration of the patents, any
person would have had the right to manufacture Singer
machines, but only the Singer Manufacturing Company
would have had the use of the name "Singer."</p>

<p>It was held by the courts that the right to use the name
"Singer", as applied to machines of this particular design,
became public property when the patents expired. The
court said, in the case of <cite>Brill v Singer Mfg. Co.</cite> (41 Ohio
St.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A patentee or his assignee, by incorporating
into his trade-mark the distinctive name by which
a patented machine has become known to the
public during the existence of the patent, cannot,
after the expiration of the patent, take away
from the public the right of using such name.
The trade-mark cannot be made a guise for extending
the monopoly, or preventing the name
from becoming, with the patent, the property of
the public."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>But if the trade-mark is adopted and used before the
article is patented, the exclusive right to the trade-mark continues
after the patent expires.</em></p>

<p>In this case the patent is secondary to the trade-mark,
and the trade-mark is held not to be descriptive. The word
"Gants" was used as a trade-mark on corsets for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
years before the article was patented. At the expiration
of the patent, another manufacturer began to make corsets of
this description, calling them "Gants". On the showing of
the plaintiff that the patent was subsequent to the adoption
of the trade-mark, the defendant was enjoined from using
the name, although there was nothing to prevent him from
continuing to make corsets of this description.</p>

<p><em>An individual has a right to use his own name in business
transactions, but he cannot use it in a way that will deceive,
directly or by inference, those who buy his goods. He cannot
use the likeness of his name to that of another party of
the same name for the purpose of trading on the latter's
established reputation.</em></p>

<p>This principle of equity is well illustrated by the legal
contentions over the name Baker, used as a trade-mark for
chocolate.</p>

<p>For a hundred and thirty-one years the firm of Walter
Baker &amp; Co., and its predecessors, have manufactured chocolate
at Dorchester, Mass. For more than a generation
past, the firm has done business under its present name.
"Baker's Cocoa," as the principal product of the firm is
popularly called, has achieved great success. This national
popularity of the name "Baker" as applied to cocoa and
chocolates, began, some years ago, to attract other persons
by the name of Baker. One of the Bakers&mdash;a William H.&mdash;began
to manufacture chocolate in Winchester, Va., in
1894, and put it on the market, labeled "W. H. Baker &amp;
Co." At that time the products of Walter Baker &amp; Co.
were labeled "W. Baker &amp; Co." It can be seen that the
substitution of W. H. Baker &amp; Co.'s goods for those of
Walter Baker &amp; Co., was an easy matter for any retailer who
wanted to do it. The packages were much alike. The retailer
made a larger profit on the product of W. H. Baker
&amp; Co.</p>

</div>

<p>Walter Baker &amp; Co. sued W. H. Baker in the Federal
Court in Virginia, and at the same time began a suit against
W. H. Baker's New York agent, Sanders, to prevent their
use of the name "Baker" or the firm name, "Baker &amp; Co."
In the Virginia suit, the opinion of the court was that
while W. H. Baker had a right to use the name "Baker,"
it being his own name, he could not use it in connection
with the sale of cocoa or chocolate unless he made a distinction
between it and the name of Walter Baker &amp; Co.
which would be easily observed by customers. The nature
of the required distinction was not specified by this court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>In the suit in the Federal
Court for the Southern District
of New York against
Sanders, the New York agent
of W. H. Baker, the court's
decision was essentially the
same as that of the Federal
Court in Virginia. The New
York court specified, however,
that the defendant should put
in conspicuous lettering on
his packages these words:
"W. H. Baker is distinct from
and has no connection with
the old chocolate manufactory
of Walter Baker &amp; Company."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>The Walter Baker Package</em><br />
(<em>Back</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>This suit had been settled
a year or two, when in New
York, another Baker&mdash;William P.&mdash;began to sell a "Baker's
Chocolate." Suit being brought to enjoin him by Walter
Baker &amp; Co., it was decided by the court that he must not
use the name "Baker" alone, or "W. Baker." He was allowed
to use his own name if spelled in full, "William
Phillips Baker," or he might use a middle initial&mdash;"William
P. Baker"&mdash;and he was directed to state on his labels that
his goods were made and sold by "William P. Baker, of
New York."</p>

<p>The contentions of the various Bakers were stilled and
the mantle of peace lay upon
them for a short space. Then,
as the record shows, a William
H. Baker, of Syracuse, felt
the calling of chocolate manufacturer
stir within him.</p>

<p>The William H. Baker
of Syracuse imitated the packages
and labels of the William
H. Baker of Winchester,
Va. His evident intention
was to make it appear that he
was the William H. Baker
who had been enjoined by
Walter Baker &amp; Co., for he
stated conspicuously on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
label "W. H. Baker is distinct from and has no connection
with the old chocolate manufactory of Walter Baker &amp; Co."</p>

<p>William H. Baker, of Winchester, Va., brought suit
against the Syracuse Baker to prevent him from using the
former's label. Injunction was granted, but the defendant
was permitted to use the name "William H. Baker" if he
printed the name "Syracuse" conspicuously in connection
with it.</p>

<p>The suit of <cite>Royal Baking Powder Co. v Royal</cite> (122
Fed. 337&mdash;1903; 58 C. C. A. 499-506), deals with the
controversy of this well-known baking powder concern over
the use of the name "Royal" on baking powder by an individual
by the name of "Royal." The court held that
Royal could make and sell baking powder under his own
name, but to prevent confusion he should not place his name
on the front label, and that he should make it inconspicuous.</p>

</div>

<p>From a consideration of these cases, and many others
where the same issue was involved, the principle may be
definitely established that,
while courts will not prevent
an individual from using his
name altogether, they will restrict
the manner of its use
when there is shown an intention
to trade on another's
reputation.</p>

<p><em>It is a settled principle of
law that a complainant must
appear in a court of equity
with clean hands. In other
words, an essential misrepresentation
of a complainant's
goods, by means of his trade-mark,
or on his labels, or
through advertisements, is a
bar against his action for relief from infringement.</em></p>

<p>One Flavel made and sold a stove under the name
"Flavel's Patent Kitchener." The defendant, Harrison, began
to make and sell another stove under the same name.
Flavel sued to enjoin Harrison, but an injunction was denied
when it was shown that Flavel's stove was not patented,
although its name would lead one to believe that it was made
under a patent.</p>

<p>In another case, the makers of a toilet preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
known as "The Balm of a Thousand Flowers" brought suit
to enjoin another party from selling a similar preparation
under the name of "The Balm of Ten Thousand Flowers."
The complainant's motion to enjoin was denied, when it
was shown in court that his "Balm of a Thousand Flowers"
did not contain the balm of any flower whatsoever&mdash;in fact,
was not a balm at all, but a soap&mdash;and that its chief ingredients
were oil and alcohol. It was held that the trade-mark
was deceitful and complainant's motion was denied. <cite>Fetridge
v Wells</cite> (4 A 66 Pr. 144; B. How. Pr. 385).</p>

<p>The infringement of trade-names and trade-marks in
most classes of merchandise is relatively infrequent compared
with the extensive substitution, infringement and
counterfeiting that are continually going on in the liquor,
wine, cigar and allied trades.</p>

<p>This had become an evil of such formidable proportions
that in 1904 an organization under the title of the Trade-Mark
Protective Company was formed to run down and
prosecute offenders. The clients of this company are mostly
importers and producers of whiskies, wines, olive oils, cordials,
cigarettes and cigars. The company has a staff of
skilled detectives, who are always at work looking for
imitators and counterfeiters of the goods of the company's
clients. After securing evidence of an infringement the
company undertakes the prosecution of the offenders.</p>

<p>The methods of the Trade-Mark Protective Company
in prosecuting infringers and counterfeiters are of the kind
that inspire evil-doers with terror as well as respect.</p>

<p>In many cases the bottles, or packages, and labels&mdash;including
trade-marks&mdash;have been counterfeited so perfectly,
and in such detail, that expert bottle-makers and lithographers
were required as witnesses to show the difference between
the spurious and the genuine.</p>

<p>An account of a few of the cases prosecuted by the Trade-Mark
Protective Company are given here for the purpose
of showing the methods of this class of dealers in spurious
goods.</p>

<p>One Young, doing business as the "Cincinnati Distilling
Company" was found using counterfeits of the labels of the
Wilson Distilling Company. He was tried, convicted, and
sentenced to six months in the workhouse and to pay a fine
of $300.</p>

<p>A cigar dealer, when asked by customers for the well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"Romeo and Juliet" cigar, which bears a label reading
"Romeo y Julieta", sold an imitation bearing a label on
which the words "Romeo, el Amante de Julietta" appeared&mdash;the
words "Romeo" and "Julietta" being in large type.
The cigars bearing this label were seized, and the dealer was
restrained from selling any "Romeo and Juliet" cigar which
did not bear the genuine label.</p>

<p>On this page are shown pictures of two bottles, each
labeled "Old Tom Gin". The bottle with the spurious
label, shown on the right, is identical in size and shape with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the genuine bottle. The labels are so much alike, in design
and coloring, that one would easily pass for the other on
casual, careless inspection. Upon obtaining the requisite
evidence the spurious stock was seized, and the use of the
imitation label was enjoined.</p>

<p>In the case of the owners of Edouard Pernod's Absinthe
against John B. Van Opstal and others it was shown that
the defendants were selling an imitation of Pernod's Absinthe
under the fictitious name of "Aernod's" Absinthe, relying
upon the similarity in sound to deceive purchasers. In this
case the label of the genuine Pernod was closely imitated in
design and color, and second-hand Pernod bottles were used.</p>

<p>The defendants being brought into court, a judgment
and injunction was entered against them.</p>

<p>On the next page are two Chartreuse labels. The one
on the right, bearing the name "Garnier" is genuine. The
labels were exactly the same size and color. The infringing
label was so clearly an imitation that the offending party did
not contest the case, but surrendered the imitation labels
to the Trade-Mark Protective Company, and agreed never
to use them again.</p>

<p>Since the expulsion of the Chartreuse monks from France,
and their settlement in Spain, they have adopted a new
label, but the original label as shown here is also still used
by them.</p>

<p>They have established their right to the exclusive use of
the name "Chartreuse" in the United States by a suit
recently decided by the Supreme Court. Reference to this
case has been made on <a href="#Ref_35">page 35</a> of this book.</p>

<p>In another case, where an infringement of Fernet Branca
Bitters was prosecuted, the defendant claimed that he had
a right to use the name, as his partner was named Branca,
and that this partner was a skilled worker in the preparation
of bitters. He was, nevertheless, restrained from using the
Fernet Branca name on his labels.</p>

<p>Most of these prosecutions are based on the law of unfair
trade, but in one case, that of Petrotta, accused of selling
counterfeit Martell Brandy and other liquors, the complainant
founded his case on the charge of larceny. He
held that in selling spurious goods for genuine the defendant
obtained money under false pretences, and in that respect he
is like a person who obtains money on a worthless check.
This argument was upheld by the court, and Petrotta was
sent to prison for two years.</p>

<p>This case is notable, in that it is the first case on record
of a conviction for larceny of money obtained on a sale of
counterfeit goods.</p>

<p>The refilling of bottles is a specific offence, covered by
statutes in some of the states. It is needless to say that
it is extremely difficult to obtain evidence of refilling that
will convict.</p>

<p>In the case of the <cite>People v Luhrs</cite> (195 N. Y., 377), in
which the defendant Luhrs was charged with having refilled
a Wilson Whiskey bottle, he put in the unusual defence that
although he refilled a Wilson Whiskey bottle, he refilled it
with Wilson Whiskey. But the New York penal code states
that it is unlawful to sell any goods which are represented
to be the manufacture of any other party than the seller,
unless such goods "are contained, in the original packages,
and under the labels, marks or names pasted thereon by the
manufacturer."</p>

<p>The defendant contended that this law was unconstitutional,
because it prevented him from selling his legitimate
property in any way he chose to sell it, and thus deprived
him of his property without due process of law. The court
did not accept this contention, as the defendant obviously
had the right to sell Wilson Whiskey any way he might
desire, and at any price, on the condition that he did not sell
it in a trade-marked package that had contained other goods.
The trade-mark certifies both to the manufacture and the
packing of contents. By refilling bottles, even with the same
kind of goods, the dealer makes a false representation, as the
bottle would not contain, after refilling, what was originally
put in it.</p>

<h3 id="Ref_68">Infringement by Foreigners Through
Importation</h3>

<p>Manufacturers are protected against infringement by
foreigners sending goods bearing infringing trade-marks and
labels to the United States by Section 27 of the Act of 1905,
which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That no article of imported merchandise which shall copy or
simulate the name of any domestic manufacture, or manufacturer or
trader, or of any manufacturer or trader located in any foreign
country which, by treaty, convention, or law affords similar privileges
to citizens of the United States, or which shall copy or simulate
a trade-mark registered in accordance with the provisions of this act,
or shall bear a name or mark calculated to induce the public to believe
that the article is manufactured in the United States, or that
it is manufactured in any foreign country or locality other than the
country or locality in which it is in fact manufactured, shall be
admitted to entry at any custom-house of the United States; and, in
order to aid the officers of the customs in enforcing this prohibition,
any domestic manufacturer or trader, and any foreign manufacturer
or trader, who is entitled under the provisions of a treaty, convention,
declaration, or agreement, between the United States and
any foreign country to the advantages afforded by law to citizens of
the United States in respect to trade-marks and commercial names,
may require his name and residence, and the name of the locality in
which his goods are manufactured, and a copy of the certificate of
registration of his trade-mark, issued in accordance with the provisions
of this act, to be recorded in books which shall be kept for
this purpose in the Department of the Treasury, under such regulations
as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe, and may furnish
to the Department facsimiles of his name, the name of the locality
in which his goods are manufactured, or of his registered trade-mark;
and thereupon the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause one
or more copies of the same to be transmitted to each collector or

<h2><span class="mediumfont">CHAPTER V</span><br />

Assignment</h2>

<p class="dropcap">It is a fixed principle of the law that a trade-mark cannot
be assigned, or transferred, without a transfer of the
business with which it is associated.</p>

<p>Trade-marks indicate origin. They are intimately associated
with the merchandise for which they are registered.
This being a fundamental principle of trade-mark law, it can
be understood that a trade-mark cannot pass from hand to
hand, and transferred as a separate thing, without losing
its real function as a trade-mark.</p>

<p>The Act of 1905 (Section 10) provides that any registered
trade-mark may be assigned "in connection with the
good-will of the business in which the mark is used."</p>

<p>In the case of <cite>MacMahan Pharmacal Co. v Denver
Chemical Mfg. Co</cite>. (113 Fed. R. 468), the court said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A trade-mark cannot be assigned, or its use
licensed, except as incidental to a transfer of the
business or property in connection with which
it has been used. An assignment or license without
such a transfer is totally inconsistent with
the theory upon which the value of a trade-mark
depends and its appropriation by an individual
is permitted. The essential value of a trade-mark
is that it identifies to the trade the merchandise
upon which it appears as of a certain
origin, or as the property of a certain person.... Disassociated
from merchandise to
which it properly appertains, it lacks the essential
characteristics which alone gives it value,
and becomes a false and deceitful designation."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a silk fabric bearing a "Radium" trade-mark,
and known in the trade, and among consumers as "Radium
Silk." The manufacturers of this fabric, The Gilbert Manufacturing
Company, assigned this trade-mark in 1905
to another concern (Eiseman &amp; Company). With the
trade-mark they turned over to Eiseman &amp; Company all the
manufactured and labeled goods then in their possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Thereupon the Gilbert Company ceased to use the trade-mark,
but did not stop manufacturing the goods, which they
put upon the market under the name "Electra". It seems
to have been understood by Eiseman &amp; Company, according
to the evidence, that the Gilbert Company was to continue
making the goods, provided they gave their product some
other name than "Radium". As soon as Eiseman &amp; Company
obtained the assignment of the trade-mark they, too,
began to manufacture the fabric, and sell it under the
"Radium" trade-mark.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i_078.png" width="275" height="203" alt="GENUINE, 'BULL' DURHAM, SMOKING TOBACCO, STANDARD OF THE WORLD" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A trade-mark, or an advertising
character, or a catch phrase,
may be so thoroughly advertised
that it becomes better known
than the commodity to which it
applies. A little New York girl,
age six, who had hardly passed
a day of her young life without
seeing a ferocious Durham bull
glaring from billboards and the
fences of vacant lots, gravely
said to her mother one day:
"Mamma, is all tobacco made
from bulls?"</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Now the matter comes into court through the suit of
Eiseman &amp; Company to prevent
a third manufacturer
from using the "Radium"
trade-mark. They contended
that the assignment of the
mark to them by its original
owner, The Gilbert Mfg.
Co., gave them the exclusive
right to its use.</p>

<p>The court held that, in the
first place, the assignment of
the trade-mark to Eiseman &amp;
Company was invalid, because
it was not accompanied by a
transfer of the good-will; in
the second place, the fact that
the Gilbert Company discontinued
the use of the trade-mark,
constituted an abandonment.
Injunction was denied.</p>

<p>In this case, the court said: "When a trader has sold
some particular article under a selected name to such an
extent as to secure registration, he has established a special
business in which that trade-mark is used, and if the trade-mark
becomes so valuable as to induce him to sell it, he
must, as a condition of transfer under the statute, assign
that special business with the trade-mark of which it was the
parent. Eiseman &amp; Company, therefore, acquired no rights
under the alleged assignment, which did not carry the special
business."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>While this trade-mark
is simple,
it lacks attractiveness
and euphony.
It is without
distinction,
and is easily
overlooked and
forgotten.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>There are exceptions, however, to this rule. The nature
of these exceptions may be best shown by citing a case&mdash;that
of <cite>Witthaus v Braun</cite> (44 Maryland&mdash;1875). In
this case a tobacco dealer, who did not manufacture goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
himself, had special brands made for him by a manufacturer.
The tobacco dealer owned the brands, and merely hired the
manufacturer to make his goods. The dealer assigned to
the manufacturer "all his smoking tobacco brands", without
transferring any other part of his business.
It was held that in this case the
assignment was valid, because the origin
of the goods had not been changed by the
transaction. The same manufacturer
continued to make the tobacco, the only
difference being that he now owned the
business, instead of making the goods on
contract.</p>

<p>The right to use a trade-mark identified with a business
location may pass, under certain circumstances, to a purchaser
of the building.</p>

<p>The purchaser of a hotel building, for example, buys
with it the right to use its name, unless a specific stipulation
to the contrary is made.</p>

<p>A theatre building known as Booth's Theatre was owned
and managed by one Booth. After several years of occupancy,
he leased the building to another person, who proceeded
to give theatrical performances there. In his advertisements
he referred to the place as Booth's Theatre,
giving his own name as lessee. Thereupon, Booth attempted
to enjoin this use of the name. The court held
that the name passed with the lease of the building.</p>

<p>In cases where the business is of such a personal nature
that the trade-mark or trade-name is identified in the public
mind with the work of some particular individual, it is
obvious that deception would be practised if the same identifying
mark were used after that individual had ceased his
connection with the enterprise. In such cases, there can be
no valid transfer of the trade-mark even though the entire
business, including good-will, is sold. Such a trade-mark is
personal. Its use on goods indicates the special knack or
skill of some one person.</p>

<p>The courts will protect the purchaser of a business in
the use of its trade-mark or trade-name against infringement
by the former owner, even though the trade-name is that of
the former owner.</p>

<p>This principle is illustrated in the case of <cite>Jergens Co.
v Woodbury</cite>, given in the New York Law Journal (Nov.
1907). The Jergens Company was the sales agent of John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
H. Woodbury, the celebrated dermatologist, in the sale of
"Woodbury's Facial Soap." In 1901 Woodbury assigned
the business to the complainant. Under the complainant's
management a large and profitable sale for the soap was
established.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_080.png" width="150" height="184" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>The famous
Woodbury trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1906, Woodbury started to manufacture soap again,
calling his product "Woodbury's New Skin
Soap." This product, so far as the package
or wrappers were concerned, had no
resemblance to the complainant's soap, the
only point of similarity being in the name.</p>

<p>In a suit brought in the New York
Supreme Court it was held by the court
that there was ground for belief that the
public would be misled by defendant's use
of the name Woodbury, and he was accordingly
enjoined.</p>

<p>This case went up to the Court of Appeals, and that
court upheld the decision of the lower court, in so far as
the defendant was restrained from using the name Woodbury
in connection with the sale of soap in such a way that
the public would be led to believe that his product was
"Woodbury's Facial Soap" or a new brand thereof.</p>

<p>For the assignment of a trade-mark no particular form
of assignment is required except it must be in writing.</p>

<p>The law provides that assignments may be recorded in
the Patent Office. If any assignment is not recorded within
three months after its date, it will be held void as against a
subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration.</p>

Trade-Marks in Canada</h2>

<p class="dropcap">Trade-marks are registered in Canada in the
Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The Canadian law recognizes two kinds of
trade-marks, viz.: General Trade-marks and Specific Trade-marks.
These two kinds of marks require separate registrations.</p>

<p>A "general trade-mark" means a trade-mark used in
connection with the sale of various articles in which a
proprietor deals in his trade, business, occupation or calling
generally.</p>

<p>A "specific trade-mark" means a trade-mark used in connection
with the sale of a class of merchandise of a particular
description.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="175" height="221" alt="Corticelli, SPOOL SILK" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>The Corticelli kitten
is both a trade-mark
and an advertising
character.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>In this respect the Canadian and American trade-mark
laws differ materially. The American
law does not recognize a "general"
trade-mark&mdash;that is, a trade-mark applicable
to any merchandise a manufacturer
may produce, irrespective of its class. An
American trade-mark is registered for
use in connection with a specific product,
or for use in connection with a class of
merchandise, all the units of which have
the same general descriptive qualities.
The "specific trade-mark" of Canada
corresponds closely to the American
trade-mark.</p>

<p>The Canadian definition of a trade-mark
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All marks, names, labels, brands, packages
or other business devices, which are adopted for
use by any person in his trade, business, occupation
or calling, for the purpose of distinguishing
any manufacture, product or article of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
description manufactured, produced, compounded,
packed or offered for sale by him, applied in any
manner whatever either to such manufacture,
product or article, or to any package, parcel,
case, box or other vessel, or receptacle of any
description whatsoever containing the same, shall,
for the purposes of this Act, be considered and
known as trade-marks."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Trade-mark Act of Canada is more broad and
liberal than the American Act, as is shown by this definition
of trade-marks. Not only are marks, names, labels and
brands considered trade-marks, but "packages" and "other
business devices" are also included.</p>

<p>An applicant who seeks to register a trade-mark must
state in his application whether the trade-mark is intended
to be general or specific. If specific, a description of the
merchandise on which it is to be used must be made a part
of the application.</p>

<p>A general trade-mark, once registered, shall "endure
without limitation."</p>

<p>The registration of a specific trade-mark expires in
twenty-five years, but it may be renewed at the end of that
period, and so on from time to time.</p>

<p>The registration fee for a general trade-mark is $30.00;
for a specific trade-mark, $25.00.</p>

<p>The Minister of Agriculture may refuse to register a
trade-mark for any one of the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. If he is not satisfied that the applicant
is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of
such trade-mark.</p>

<p>2nd. If the trade-mark proposed for registration
is identical with or resembles a trade-mark
already registered.</p>

<p>3rd. If it appears that a trade-mark is calculated
to deceive or mislead the public.</p>

<p>4th. If the trade-mark contains any immorality
or scandalous figure.</p>

<p>5th. If the so-called trade-mark does not
contain the essentials necessary to constitute a
trade-mark, properly speaking.</p></blockquote>

<p>The "essentials necessary to constitute a trade-mark"
are not defined by the law, an omission which means that
the English common law definition of a valid trade-mark,
as shown by the decisions of the courts, must be the basis on
which eligibility to registration is based. No mark or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
symbol which has a designating or descriptive quality may
be registered.</p>

<p>When a descriptive word has been registered, through
error of the registrar, it does not give the owner of the mark
exclusive right to its use. As in the United States, registration
is only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> evidence of validity.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_083a.png" width="200" height="167" alt="AMERICAN SHEET &amp; TIN PLATE CO., APOLLO, BEST BLOOM, TRADE MARK REGISTERED, PITTSBURGH" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A trade-mark used on
sheet tin. It is affixed
by stenciling.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The right to a trade-mark belongs
to the first user of the mark.
If it is registered by any other person
than its first user, the registration
may be set aside as invalid upon the
production of proof of its prior use
by any other person than the registrant.</p>

<p>The law states that "no person
shall institute any proceeding to prevent
the infringement of any trade-mark, unless such trade-mark
is registered in pursuance of this act."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A well-advertised
trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>This provision of the law would seem to exclude actions
based on the common law, but in practice the Canadian
courts take cognizance of the doctrine of unfair trade.
The prime requisite of registration
before infringement proceedings can
be instituted merely makes the mode
of procedure different from that in
the United States. The complainant
must get his trade-mark registered
before he begins his suit against the
infringement. If the mark alleged to infringe has already
been registered, the plaintiff moves to set the registration
aside as invalid, and have his own mark registered instead
of it.</p>

<p>A circular containing the full provisions of the Canadian
law, with directions and forms for making an application
for registration, may be obtained by any person who will
write for it to the Minister of Agriculture, Ottawa, Canada.</p>

How to Devise a Trade-Mark</h2>

<p class="dropcap">A Trade-mark may be a word, or words; or a
device; or a device combined with a word or words.</p>

<p>It is often considered desirable to register the
name of a product as a trade-mark. Consequently, in the
case of new products, the selection of a trade-mark often
means the selection of a name for the merchandise with which
the trade-mark is to be used.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A familiar and excellent
example of
a coined word used
as a trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A trade-mark, to be valid, should not have any meaning
obviously descriptive of the goods for which it is registered.
The word "Crex", to illustrate our meaning, is an arbitrary
coined word. As such it is registrable, and besides its undoubted
validity, it has some of the
best qualities that a trade-mark can
possess, in that it is short&mdash;of one
syllable&mdash;easy to pronounce and remember,
and its sound is not displeasing
to the ear. Note that in the name
"Crex Grass Furniture", the word
"Crex" is alone registrable. "Grass
Furniture" is a descriptive term.</p>

<p>Coined words, like Karo, Onoto, Chiclets, Crisco,
Uneeda, Jap-a-lac, Sapolio, are virtually infringement proof.
The ownership of a coined word, as applied to the commodity
with which it is associated, rests absolutely in the individual
or concern that first uses it.</p>

<p>Many of these coined words are only fortuitous combinations
of letters, arrived at after divers experiments. Such a
word is "Onoto", applied to a fountain pen. It was selected
from a list of hundreds of similar names, in which all sorts
of curious arrangements of letters were set down.</p>

<p>In the creation of an artificial or "coined" word, a mere
misspelling of a word or phrase does not make it registrable,
if it would not be so otherwise. "Bestok", a misspelling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"Best Stock", was refused registration, as it is plainly
descriptive.</p>

<p>"Omo" is the trade-mark of a dress shield; "Persil"&mdash;a
coined word&mdash;is a washing compound; and "Steero" is the
trade-mark and the name of bouillon cubes.</p>

<p>"Sealpackerchief" is a name made up of "Sealed",
"Package" and "Handkerchief". It is the trade-name of a
brand of handkerchiefs that are sold in clean sealed packages.</p>

<p>"Nabisco" is a name made by joining together the first
syllables of the three words "National Biscuit
Co."&mdash;Na-Bis-Co&mdash;Nabisco.</p>

</div>

<p>The Government of the Island of Porto Rico has
given its encouragement and material support to the
formation of an association among the large planters,
shippers and manufacturers of the Island. This organization,
known as the Porto Rico Association, is active
in promoting the sale
of Porto Rican products
in the United
States. As a guaranty
of the quality of the
goods, each member of
the Association&mdash;after
his shipment has been
inspected and approved&mdash;has
the right to use
the "Porto Rico seal of
quality", shown here.
This seal is not a trade-mark
in the technical
sense, but it is affixed to Porto Rican merchandise of
high quality, sold at the New York store of the Porto
Rico Association at 510 Fifth Avenue, New York, and
elsewhere, and in that relation it is a common law
trade-mark, with ownership vested in the Porto Rico
Association.</p>
</div>

<p>The name "Roxonia", a registered trade-mark, applied
to hosiery and underwear, is an evolution of the name Roxburghe.
When the goods were first put on the market the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Duke of Roxburghe was on a visit to the United States,
"taking notice" of an heiress, and was, in virtue of this situation,
much in the public prints. A manufacturer of underwear
thought Roxburghe sounded
pretty good, and he applied for registration
of the name as a trade-mark.
His application was refused on the
ground that Roxburghe was the
name of a person. Abandoning
"Roxburghe", another cogitation of
the subject brought to light the word
"Saxonia", this name having been suggested by the fact that
Saxony is one of the great centers of hosiery production.
"Saxonia" was refused registration because it is a geographical
term. The addition of two letters to the word "Saxon"
does not make sufficient change to remove it from the prohibited
class of geographical terms. With these two rejections
before him, it occurred to the manufacturer that he
could unite the two words, and get rid of the objectionable
feature of each. This was done, and the result is "Roxonia",
which is not only a valid trade-mark, but a very good one.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_086a.png" width="200" height="95" alt="REG. US ARCO PAT OFF, SPOTZOFF" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>The clever trade-mark
of a cleaning fluid.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A trade-mark may consist of a coined word which is suggestive,
but not descriptive. An example of this is shown in
the "Arco Spotzoff" trade-mark. This is the name, as well
as the trade-mark, of a cleaning fluid. "Spots Off", spelled
in any way whatsoever, suggests cleaning and cleanliness,
but it does not describe the cleaning fluid. This is a very
ingenious trade-mark. With a slight variation it would be
unregistrable. For instance, "Spot Remover" would not be
valid, because it is an ordinary descriptive term&mdash;an advertisement,
in short.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i_086b.png" width="325" height="87" alt="RUBEROID, (Trade Mark. Reg. U. S. Pat. Office)" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>Susceptible of mispronunciation.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Two other examples of coined words, suggestive but not
descriptive, are "Sealpackerchief"&mdash;mentioned
above&mdash;and "Hydegrade".</p>

<p>In some instances,
there is a sort of tangential,
or left-handed suggestiveness,
about a trade-mark
which gives it a significance quite different from the
idea that was in its owner's mind when he adopted it. This
is a defect in any trade-mark. An example of this is the
"Ruberoid" trade-mark, applied to a high-quality, ready-to-lay
roofing, sold in rolls. It is pronounced "Rue-ber-oid".
The owners of this product state, in their advertising, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Ruberoid does not contain any rubber. It is not a rubber
roofing. But a large percentage of the public pronounces
the word "Rubber-oid", and many people have the impression
that Ruberoid is a rubber roofing. The name is suggestive
of rubber. This effect is not an intentional one, as
is plainly shown by the widely advertised
statement of the owners that Ruberoid
contains no rubber, as well as by their taking
the trouble to indicate the correct
pronounciation in their advertisements.</p>

Sons.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A trade-mark name should not be easily
susceptible of mispronunciation.</p>

<p>An arbitrary symbol may be a valid
trade-mark. The Wilbur Chocolate trade-mark,
showing a Cupid stirring a cup
with a large spoon, is an example of an arbitrary symbol
used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The McCutcheon trade-mark, consisting of the representation
of an old-fashioned spinning wheel,
is arbitrary in the sense of not being descriptive,
but it is suggestive of flax and
fine linen, which is a specialty of the
McCutcheon store.</p>

<p>The trade-mark of Domino sugar is

<p>Initials, like "E. &amp; W."&mdash;used on
Earl &amp; Wilson collars; "G.E."&mdash;the
trade-mark of the General Electric Company; and "R &amp; G"&mdash;used
on corsets, are valid as trade-marks.</p>

</div>

<p>A trade-mark may be the name of a fictitious person, like
"Buster Brown", used in connection
with hosiery, and "Dorothy Dodd" used
as a trade-mark for shoes.</p>

<p>A famous example of initials used for
this purpose is the "B.V.D." trade-mark.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>An excellent, distinctive
trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Good trade-marks are simple and
distinctive. The mark should be of
such a character that it can be easily retained
in the purchaser's memory, and it is apparent that this
is not readily done when it is complicated
and commonplace.</p>

<p>Look at the "Sonor" trade-mark,
reproduced on this page, as an illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of this point. The lettering is so involved that it is
difficult to read, and it looks like a pattern of some intricate
fancy work. Compare it with the simple, clear-cut "Rub-dry"
trade-mark.</p>

<div id="Ref_80" class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_088a.png" width="150" height="198" alt="BIRD, NEPONSET, PRODUCTS, TRADE MARK, Reg. U. S. Pat. Off." />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A trade-mark cluttered
up with too
much detail.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The "Neponset" trade-mark has so
much in it, including the picture of a child
in a rainstorm, that it loses its character
when it is reduced to any practical, small
size for advertising purposes. The single
word "Neponset", enclosed in a simple
design, would be much more effective&mdash;or
the child holding the piece of roofing over
her head would be equally effective, if
shown alone, without a background.</p>

<p>An example of a commonplace trade-mark
is the big "P" surrounded by a circle. This mark
lacks distinction and originality. It makes but little impression
upon a reader's mind, and is soon forgotten.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_088b.png" width="150" height="150" alt="p, TRADE MARK" />
<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A trade-mark that
bears a startling
resemblance to a
soda-water check.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Compare the big "P" with the admirable "Pacific" Mills
trade-mark. The Pacific Mills emblem is graceful, simple,
distinctive, and has a swing and a whirl
to it that suggest motion. When a
symbol is used as a trade-mark it is always
advisable to put the suggestion of
motion into it, if this can be done without
the sacrifice of some other essential
quality. A thing in motion arrests the
eye, and holds the attention, much better
than a still figure. Evidence of this is
seen in the well-known Dutch Cleanser
trade-mark, where the motion of the
lady in wooden shoes dominates every other quality of the
symbol.</p>

<p>An arbitrary number may be a valid trade-mark. The
number "830" has been judicially held to be a good trade-mark
for a brand of hosiery. The number "4711"&mdash;an
arbitrary arrangement of figures&mdash;has been in use since 1792
as a trade-mark for toilet preparations. The numerals "1"
to "35" are valid trade-marks, as applied to Humphrey's
Homeopathic Remedies.</p>

<p>A numeral indicating quality or composition cannot be
protected against infringement.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>This design is very attractive.
A fine example of a
symbol with wording.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A trade-mark may be the name of a mythological character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
like Juno, Venus&mdash;there is a Venus lead pencil&mdash;Hercules,
or Apollo, this last name being used in connection
with a player-piano. It may be
the name of an historical character,
like Voltaire, Buckingham, Mazarin,
Napoleon&mdash;used with a
brand of flour&mdash;or Champlain; or
Samson, used as a name of a
clothes-line sold in a package. It
may be the name of a character in
fiction, like Hamlet, David Copperfield,
Hypatia or Portia. "Pequot",
the name of an extinct
Indian tribe, is the trade-marked
name of a brand of sheets and
pillow cases. The name of an existing Indian tribe is
not valid as a trade-mark, as it has a geographical significance.</p>

<p>A phrase in common use may be registered as a trade-mark,
provided it has none of the qualities prohibited by the
Act of 1905. For example, "Yours Truly" is the registered
trade-mark of an article of food.</p>

<p>A word in common use may be valid as a trade-mark if
it has no defects under the act. There is, for instance, an
"Arrow" collar, a "Lion" collar, and a "Velvet" smoking
tobacco. If careful consideration is given to the selection,
it is sometimes possible to find an ordinary word that may be
very effective as a trade-mark. There is, for example, the
word "Rainbow", used as a name for dyes. This word is
not descriptive of the dyes, but it is tremendously suggestive
of their quality and their wide range of colors.</p>

<p>"Gold Cross" is the trade-mark of a brand of condensed
milk.</p>

<p>"Skidoo" is the particularly happy name of a rough-and-ready
soap, and this is also used as the trade-mark of a marine
engine. "Flash" is the name of a soap. "Bread Winner"
is the trade-name of a line of children's suits.</p>

<p>There are many trade-marks made up of two or more
words, such as "Bachelor's Friend", for hosiery; "Iron-Clad",
also a hosiery trade-mark, and "Porosknit"&mdash;a coined
word made up of "Porous" and "Knit".</p>

<p>The portrait and name of a living person may be registered
as a trade-mark, provided the application is accompanied
by the written permission of the person whose name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
portrait are shown. There is a "Maxine Elliott Soap", and
a "Mrs. Rorer's Coffee".</p>

<p>The name of a natural object used in a fanciful sense,
may be registered. There are many examples of this usage,
such as "Beech-Nut" bacon, "Ivy" corset, "Hawkeye"
camera, and "Eagle" condensed milk.</p>

<p>A trade-mark may consist of a fanciful combination of
words, like "Blue Jay", applied to corn plasters; "Red
Devil", "Silver Moon", and "Flying Cat".</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="marginleft"><em>A well-balanced and handsome
design.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>When a design and wording are used in combination,
care should be taken to make
them fit together without discord.
Attractiveness is a quality
that is desirable in a trade-mark
if it can be attained without
a sacrifice of more virile
features. The Ipswich Hosiery
trade-mark is eye-catching and
attractive. It contains as much
in lettering and in illustration as
the Neponset trade-mark shown
on <a href="#Ref_80">page 80</a>, and it is much more
attractive. This trade-mark&mdash;as
shown in the accompanying engraving&mdash;is descriptive, as it
contains the word "hosiery", and it contains a geographical
term&mdash;"Ipswich". These features would probably prevent
its registration under the general Act of 1905, but not under
the ten years' clause of that act, provided it could fulfil the
requirements of that clause.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Swift &amp; Co.'s trade-mark.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The trade-mark of Swift &amp; Company, of Chicago, is
unusually distinctive. Its symbolism is interpreted in a circular
issued by Swift &amp; Company, of which the following
is an excerpt:</p>

<p>"Four factors intimately combined enter into the symbol.
They are: (1) the 'S', (2) the dart, (3) the circle, (4)
the pivot.</p>

<p>"The 'S', combined with the dart in one piece, is a
personality symbol, serving to set forth the name 'Swift',
both accurately and generally, since the dart is an ancient
and world-wide symbol of swiftness.</p>

<p>"The dart by itself is a humanity symbol, carrying the
thought of speed and directness. In its position in the
symbol it indicates high aim and rectitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"The circle is a humanity symbol, carrying the thought
of universality, and everywhere recognized as the perfect
form.</p>

<p>"The pivot symbol is beautifully
developed by the 'S' which centers in
the circle, and is itself a form of the
pivot symbol.</p>

<p>"The black and red color scheme
accentuates the pivot and gives the
thought of day and night, of life and
death, of heaven and hell&mdash;in short,
the thought of dualism in life."</p>

<p>This design is simple, graceful,
distinctive, and appropriate. In a
business as far-reaching and as complex
as that of Swift &amp; Company, the quality of adaptability in a
trade-mark is highly desirable. This trade-mark is of such
a character that it may be used with appropriateness upon
merchandise, stationery, packages, boxes, sides of cars, and
in advertisements.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>No. 1.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The engravings Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, illustrate the various
steps taken in devising the trade-mark of
the W. H. McElwain Company, of Boston.
The fundamental idea was to incorporate
the initials of the firm, W. H. M., into the
design in some effective way. From a large
number of suggestions the design marked
No. 1 was selected. It can be seen that the
three bars shown in No. 1 make the initials
W. H. M.&mdash;but somebody has to tell you
before you see it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>No. 2.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The next step, shown in No. 2, was to put in the sole of
a shoe, as the trade-mark is intended for shoes, and to letter
"The McElwain Mark" across the face of the bars.</p>

<p>The design shown in No. 2 lacks cohesion and finish.
To hold it together, a border was put around it and a Ben
Day background thrown in. This produced the figure shown
in No. 3.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_092-2.png" width="150" height="151" alt="THE, McELWAIN, MARK" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>No. 3.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The design marked No. 3 is quite striking, but if you look
at it awhile you begin to see defects in it. The black initial
bars are too strong and glaring. They push the rest of the
design out of the picture. This defect was cured by putting
the initial bars in white with the sole of the shoe in black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and making the background darker. By doing this, the
proper balance between white and black was obtained.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>No. 4.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The design shown in No. 4 is the finished trade-mark.</p>

<p>In devising a trade-mark, any one who does not clearly
keep the requirements of the law in mind is likely to fall into
one or another of three classes of errors.</p>

<p>First, there is a natural tendency to make a trade-mark
descriptive, to insert in the wording some phrase like "Best
Quality", "Sold the World Over", or "Fits the Figure" or
"Good for Children"&mdash;all of which are descriptive phrases.
You cannot register or protect an advertisement used as a
trade-mark, and such phrases are advertisements. A trade-mark
is a thing to be advertised. It must not be an advertisement
itself.</p>

<p>Second, there is a tendency on the part of many advertisers
to incorporate their own names into their trade-marks.
This often leads to interminable and costly litigation.</p>

<p>Third, there is a tendency among manufacturers to select
geographical terms as their trade-marks, to use the name of
the towns or cities where their plants are located, or the
names of states, or of rivers or oceans. The trade-name,
"Baltimore" hosiery, has a good sound, and the word "Baltimore"
is easily remembered, simple and euphonious. But
if you are a hosiery manufacturer, and adopt it, you do so
at your peril, even if you do business in Baltimore. You
cannot protect it against any other manufacturer of hosiery
who has a plant in Baltimore, even on the grounds of unfair
competition, unless you have used the name exclusively, and
for such a long period of time, that it has lost most of its
geographical sense in the hosiery trade, and has developed
into a word of restricted meaning in that line of business.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>P.S. A manufacturer who intends to apply
for the registration of a new trade-mark should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
take the precaution to have the files of the Patent
Office searched to ascertain if a trade-mark like
his, or similar to it, has been already registered
for the same class of merchandise. This should
be done before application for registration is
made.</p>

<p>When application to register a trade-mark is
filed, the trade-mark must be already in use.
This use may be limited to affixation upon a
small consignment of goods, but it must be a
genuine and actual use of the trade-mark.</p>

<p>This being so, it is worth while to ascertain
if the proposed trade-mark has already been
registered. There are 39,000 registered trade-marks
in existence, divided among forty-nine
classes of merchandise. Thousands of trade-marks
have been registered for some classes. It
is not unusual for an applicant to find that the
trade-mark he has intended to use has been
adopted by someone else.</p></blockquote>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
